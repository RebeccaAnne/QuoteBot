His reaction to Rhodin’s words certainly ought to have been more negative than it felt, than the tiny shiver running through his body. Perhaps it was just that he did trust him, quite literally, with his life.\n“I’m guessing that sounded about as bad as I thought it would,” Rhodin said after a moment.\nCliopher cleared his throat again before speaking. “Not at all,” he finally said. “I was just–thinking. You have my full cooperation,” he continued, as if they were endeavoring to begin some interdepartmental project together.\nRhodin breathed in deeply. He was so very close, so close to touching. “You’re not afraid,” he said.\n“No,” Cliopher said simply. “Concerned, obviously. But I am not afraid of you, Rhodin, nor of what you might do to me tonight.”",
