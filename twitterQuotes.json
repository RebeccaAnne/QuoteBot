        "It was an indication of Cliopher Mdang’s status in the eyes of his lord that he was given the use of a sky ship for personal business.",
        "He no longer believed one could legislate out of existence greed, or stupidity, or sheer perversity of will. \nIt reassured him that neither could one legislate out of existence love, or hope, or the desire for beauty",
        "No one to look on his face. No one to say his name. No one to touch him. No one to be his own, and no one else’s. No one for whom he could be himself.",
        "Surely it was only petty treason.",
        "“His Radiancy would not thank me to let you fall.”",
        "A feeling of indescribable fondness welled up in him as he regarded his lord.",
        "“I used to know who I was beyond my duties.”",
        "He walked forward to meet his Radiancy, who was coming out of the water, looking (to Cliopher) like some story of Creation as the water streaming off his dark shoulders caught the light and the three men stood awaiting his coming.",
        "The distant serene reserve that usually cloaked any hint of personality was gone, and in its place was an alert, amused, interested expression. \nHe looked, in short, like a man seized with an enthusiasm. \nHe was nearly unrecognizable.",
        "“Your accent has grown noticeably stronger over the course of the day, Cliopher.”\nHe hastily put his thoughts back into courtly mode. “My apologies, my—” \n“No, do not mistake me. Pray speak as your heart moves you.”",
        "“You are speaking of his Radiancy!” \n“I do not forget it!”",
        "“Yet here you are,” his Radiancy said, smiling at him.\n“Yes, I am here,” said Cliopher, his heart singing.",
        "“What is your name, what is your island, and what is your dance?”",
        "“I will bring home the hearth-fire of a new life for the world.”",
        "“You will not let me give you riches or titles or lands or any of the other honours it is usual for a lord to give his loyal servants, so instead I offer you this as your friend.”",
        "“He called me his friend.”\n“Then you must continue to act in the office of friendship,” Cliopher said firmly.",
        "“No one will ever pay me to copy out texts, I’m afraid, but every poet should see his work in book form at least once. It is good for the soul.”",
        "“I have been wondering, my lord, whether it had occurred to you to retire.”",
        "“I spent the night before my coronation praying for the Red Company to come take me away. They did not come: and so I became Emperor.”",
        "“I am a human being, Conju! I have emotions and desires and frustrations and hopes and dreams and nightmares as much as anyone else. I have things I love and things I hate, things I prefer and things I abhor, and none of it matters.”",
        "“You still do not know what I mean, do you? You kneel to me because you dared raise your voice to me. When have I ever given you cause to think I would punish you for speaking your mind?”",
        "“Can you not understand that the walls between us are not of my making? That I do not want to be behind them? Can you not look at me and see not the Radiancy but the man?”",
        "“It was so hard to keep fighting that I had nearly stopped. I had myself nearly convinced that it was merely the responsible thing to be so—so—so dull!”",
        "“I never thought I would be the person who chose what is comfortable.”",
        "“Will you not call Ser Rhodin and Elish out of the rain?”\nLudvic turned his head and raised his eyebrows at him. “They would not come. He gave them a direct order to stay there. They will obey.”",
        "His Radiancy stood still, gazing down at him with that inscrutable expression, and then he did what Cliopher had never once seen him do: he knelt down. \n“Conju,” he said, quietly.",
        "“Conju, if you insist on resigning I will not force you to stay. But I will be very sorry indeed to see you go—and sorrier than I can say to have made you feel unworthy and a failure.”",
        "“That is not what I wished for.”",
        "“I will give you a dream, and something to remember,” she said, “and half a hundred poems for you to write to me.” \n“I hear and obey,” he said. \n“You never did,” she said, with something like amusement. “Your tides are your own, Beloved.”",
        "“My lord, may I speak very frankly?” \nHis Radiancy turned the lion gaze on him, holding his eyes for a long moment. Cliopher felt his power like a huge reservoir behind the dam of his will. \n“Yes.”",
        "“You were the first one to look at me as if I were a human being instead of a god.” \n“That was treason, my lord,” Cliopher said quietly. \nThere was another silence. “I hate my life at times, Kip.”",
        "“I have been fortunate beyond the lot of many men that not only can I, do I, admire and respect my lord and my master, but that I could, that I do, also love him.”",
        "“My Lord, my  ... Tor ... if you were my brother or my cousin I could not love you more.”",
        "“I’m a career bureaucrat, my lord, not a—”\n“You,” said his Radiancy with precision, “are not dull. Stop acting like it.”",
        "“Cliopher will not wear satin.”",
        "“Whose livery is that?” \n“Yours, sir!”",
        "“Your Radiancy stopped coughing and said: ‘Where am I?’ And I saluted and replied, ‘In the throne room of the Palace of Stars, Glorious One.’ ‘But this is not Ysthar,’ you said, ‘it is Zunidh. And the Empire is no more.”",
        "“It is a matter of wild magic. Coincidence and serendipity are to be expected.”",
        "And the centre of every gaze and every mind and every subtle line, that hundredth and last Emperor of Astandalas whom Cliopher loved.",
        "There was a glint in his Radiancy’s eyes.\nCliopher was mortally certain he was the only one in all that room looking into them.",
        "“Indeed, the strength of social pressure is one of the greatest forces in the world. The only force that is stronger is the individual will.”",
        "“It is so much harder to stand up for a small, nearly frivolous thing. It is far easier, at least in imagination, to stand up for the great things.”",
        "He spent a few silent moments preparing a new pen. Then he wrote, in precise lettering, Cliopher Lord Mdang defended the people of the Vangavaye-ve against their princess. \nThere, he thought defiantly, let history read that.",
        "“Kip,” his Radiancy said more gently. “Kip, look at me.” \n“Please, my lord,” he whispered, feeling the tears start to fall as he obeyed.",
        "He felt himself to be entirely exposed, belly-up, defeated. He said, “They have never forgiven me for leaving.” \n“Have you ever forgiven yourself?” \nCliopher looked at him, met the lion eyes. Finally dropped his eyes in submission. “No.”",
        "But, another part of him said, the Lord Chancellor of Zunidh was able to be his Radiancy’s friend ... and that was worth all the work and headaches and stress ...",
        "“If I die ... no, listen ... if I die, I have ... please ... last requests ...” \n“Whatever you want done, we will do,” Cliopher said recklessly, meaning every word.",
        "Ludvic looked up at his tone. “My lord, it is nothing for me to die in serving you.”\n“It is everything for me, Ludvic,” said his Radiancy in a low voice.",
        "“I know some of the old traditions.” \nAnd that was as much as he could say that was true, he thought, here where he chose his work over his family over and over again.",
        "“I do not ask for your political view. I wish to know what you, Kip Mdang, think.”\nCliopher met the lion eyes steadily. “My lord, I have devoted my life to your service.” \n“And?”\n“And I think that of all people, Fitzroy Angursell should be free.”",
        "“The world knows your devotion, Lord Mdang.”",
        "“To hell with the Viceroyship!”",
        "“My lord, you cannot button it away.” \n“I nearly think you said I cannot.”",
        "“You overreach yourself, sir. You are dismissed,” his Radiancy said icily, and that, he supposed, was that.",
        "“There is no way,” Ludvic burst out, “that his Radiancy would consider that treasonous from you. He loves you as a brother.” \n“He sent me away,” Cliopher whispered",
        "“Are you suggesting I go counter to a direct order?” \nThey looked at each other intently, he and Ludvic and Conju, the air heavy with anxiety and fear. Conju backed down; but Ludvic said, in his usual phlegmatic way, “How deeply do you love him?”",
        "And that even if Cliopher was not Domina Black, did not walk through the world like a thunderstrike, nevertheless he could do his best, and that if that meant he was to be executed for his love, then he would do what he could beforehand.",
        "If he was going to be executed for the treason of treating his Radiancy as a person he might as well go all the way with it. \nKnocked again, and this time into the ensuing silence he said: “Tor.”",
        "His Radiancy stood frowning down at him, his power high and menacing. Cliopher did not try to match his stare, but thought of himself as a stone being swamped by the sea. If the sea truly wished to unseat him, he knew he would have no recourse.",
        "But the wave ebbed. Ebbed from drowning Cliopher; and ebbed, he saw, from drowning that inner man whose name he did not know, save that it was almost certainly not Tor. But he had no other name to offer him.",
        "“Tor,” he said again, very softly, “please.” \nIf he had heaved a stone through a window he could not have seen a shattering as complete as what he saw breaking in his Radiancy’s eyes.",
        "He draped him with it and then he sat down on the edge of the desk and with the cloth between them held the Last Emperor of Astandalas as he cried.",
        "“I felt like a ghost. No one could touch me, and I could touch no one. I cast no shadow, and shadows did not land on me. My slightest whim was obeyed, but any real desires I had were forbidden by the entire edifice of Schooled magic and Imperial policy.”",
        "“Everyone was terrified of me. Oh, I should clarify: not me. It was never me that anyone looked at, that anyone saw, that anyone thought about. It was always the Emperor.”",
        "“I hated everything about being Emperor. Everything. I hated how other people treated me, I hated how I was expected to treat other people, I hated all the taboos, I hated the total lack of privacy, I hated the magic that was turning me inside out.”",
        "“Will you speak so to me? Will you speak so for me? Will you speak so about me?”",
        "Ludvic rubbed his left hand down the long golden scars on his arm. “It seemed right to me that I should die from his touch. For so long I have felt unworthy of living when they did not.”",
        "“At the end, when the priests came, I thought only that you were the Lord Chancellor, that you needed to know. Then I saw your face. I had not known you felt that way.”",
        "“You have a loving family big enough to include Conju, and Rhodin, and himself. And me. I am grateful. That is all.”",
        "Ludvic looked down, as if ashamed, though to Cliopher they were banners of love to be waved proudly. No one else had ever touched the Last Emperor after he became Emperor but for the Moon. No one else had ever been touched by him.",
        "“Tell him that the next time I see him I will ask him for his name.”",
        "“His Radiancy has instructed that you may have access to his person whenever you request it.”",
        "“My name is Ludvic Omo. My island is Woodlark in the Azilint. We do not have your dances, but the head of my carving is Odongai.”",
        "“Lord Artorin, my boy there wants me to tell him he can claim the fire. He’s trying not to look like he already has.”",
        "Something moved in him and prompted him to say, slowly, the traditional words. “It’s a long story of the sea to tell it.” \nAfter a moment Buru Tovo replied with the equally traditional words. “We sit by the fire ready to hear it.”",
        "“And across the Wide Seas, they said, a wall of storms.”",
        "“I should have gone. As soon as I saw the ship go I knew I should have gone ... I ...” He stopped, breath catching again. “I didn’t go. I let her go without me. I did not stand up for what I knew was the right decision.”",
        "“She sat there under an umbrella at the edge of the clearing where we worked and shouted vague instructions at me.” \n“You always respond so well to that,” his Radiancy murmured. \nCliopher smiled. “Yes, my lord.”",
        "Buru Tovo spoke sternly. “Her body went to the waves and her spirit to the call of her ancestors, guiding a fire-tender across the Wide Seas. She was Nga. She died valiantly. You may let her go from your hands.”",
        "They all looked at him. After a bit, his Radiancy said, “You’re not a wizard. You can’t tell by magic ... how did you find out where you were? For I perceive that you are now here, rather than a wild hermit on a remote isolated island.” \n“I danced.”",
        "“It is the crescent moon four days from now,” he said. “You will dance Aōteketētana then before your community here.” \n“You will dance it in the throne room,” said his Radiancy, equally firmly, and then he smiled. “At the feet of the Sun.”",
        "“Lord Lior, I would respect you more if you came right out and called me a savage.”",
        "“I lit the first fire in the Palace after the Fall of Astandalas—and I tell you, sir, I have not let it go out since.”",
        "“From the Sun-on-Earth have I learned my destination, and with the stars of my principles to guide me, I know the way.”",
        "“I do not care what anyone thinks of my work except for the Sun-on-Earth and my own heart’s conscience.”",
        "Sixteen children had she borne, and fifty-nine grandchildren in their turn, and the seed of the gardens both real and metaphorical of his grandfather were spread far and wide around the Ring and even so far as here in Solaara.",
        "He had not wanted a parade in the Vangavaye-ve. He had not wanted cheering throngs to follow him down the street. He had not even wanted things to change. \nBut he would have liked someone to say ‘congratulations’.",
        "Cliopher thought again of his Radiancy, who never had anyone to hold him against his fears. Missed him suddenly, fearfully, frighteningly.",
        "“Close your eyes, Kip, and trust me.” \nCliopher had always responded well to direct orders from those he greatly respected. He closed his eyes.",
        "“Princess Oriana,” he said finally. “I think you had better inform his Radiancy of your opinion of me.”",
        "“That was one of the most elegant and subtle displays of power it has ever been my privilege to witness, and I must thank you for the pleasure of the experience.”",
        "“His Radiancy turned Earl Baljan into a table?”\n“Yes. I didn’t know anyone could do that, outside of stories.”\nCliopher was absurdly pleased by the notion that a wizard from a book of fables would turn someone into a table on his behalf.",
        "Did you have any problems, Rhodin? Toucan?” \n“Hillen tried to bribe us,” Rhodin said. “Poorly.” \n“Five cases of Amboloyan wine were not sufficient?” \n“As it happens, I prefer my head.”",
        "“I do love a good parade.” \n“My lord, I will be delighted to arrange one for you on any occasion you please.” \n“Except this one?” His Radiancy laughed again.",
        "“I have entered in the Gates of the Sea. I see the harbour with the eyes of my body as well as the eyes of my heart.”",
        "“You have always been one of the most traditional people to come here.”",
        "“I think he would like it,” Cliopher said firmly, “but even if I am wrong, I would prefer to have the place there to be rejected than not to offer it.” \nRhodin breathed in sharply. “You do know him better than anyone else.”",
        "“His Radiancy would give you the house if you asked him.” \n“His Radiancy would probably give me an island if I asked him, but that doesn’t mean I’m going to.”",
        "Rhodin said, “I do not believe that anyone would ever think for a moment that you feel anything but the greatest love and respect for his Radiancy.”",
        "Rhodin caught his eye and said meaningfully, “Kip is his Radiancy’s closest friend.”",
        "“There’s no blasphemy in pointing out the truth. It is blindingly obvious. When you want to share some news, it is to him you look—and when he wishes to talk, it is with you.”",
        "“There is no one in this world who can say I have lied to them, Aunt Hilda, and you are not the exception.”",
        "“We expect that only Kip, and Kip alone, knows what sacrifices he has made, and to what end. We will say only that we have never had any reason to doubt his loyalty, his service, his love, his devotion to his family, or his staunch upholding of the law.”",
        "“I chose the latter course, and as a result have had the great pleasure and even greater good fortune of witnessing the development and coming to maturity of perhaps the finest statesman in recorded history.”",
        "“I have accomplished many things as Lord of Zunidh, but it is my belief that when history judges me against the greater sweep of time, my greatest achievement will be said to be appointing Cliopher Mdang to a position of authority.”",
        "“Peace, I said, expecting none. Two weeks later Kip requested an audience and handed me the draft of an agreement between the warring parties. That agreement became the foundation for the Littleridge Treaty, and those wars have never recurred.”",
        "“Do not fret that he has left you behind, for he never has. I knew your names long before I ever stepped foot in the Vangavaye-ve; and I know the philosophies of your Lays as well as any velio might.”",
        "This day was surely a gift of the Son of Laughter.",
        "Nothing was disproportionate, nothing distorted, nothing missing. Every smallest element of the design was correct, declaring his identity as a Mdang of Tahivoa in Gorjo City, whose island was Loaloa, whose dances were Aōteketētana.",
        "He did spare a thought for how likely it was that she would work to unseat him, perhaps try to have him disgraced or even assassinated. \nRhodin and Ludvic would keep him safe, he thought.",
        "“Your great-uncle said these were the necklaces,” Féonie said. “The efani, the efevoa, and the efetana.”",
        "But in that superlative version of his customary finery, he realized that what he looked like was the tanà, the Tender of the Fire, the advisor to chiefs and paramount chiefs—and emperors.",
        "“I sing the Wide Seas!”",
        "Cliopher said, “You don’t have to give me the okana, Paramount Chief, but you must know that once you have begun you must not allow the ember to go out before you have lit a new fire.” \nJiano turned to the hall. “Thus speaks the tanà!”",
        "“Lord of Rising Stars, I offer you in my hands the Vangavaye-ve.” \n“Cliopher Mdang, what is the Vangavaye-ve?” \n“Lord of Rising Stars, the Vangavaye-ve is the home of my heart, the land of my birth, the anchorage of my soul.”",
        "“Cliopher Mdang, offer us your hands.” \nCliopher was far from fear, far from the taboos. His gaze was held in golden brilliance. He reached forward—up—and around his trembling hands closed the beautiful long fingers of his beloved lord. ",
        "He felt himself in his Radiancy's regard, the one solid rock in a tumultuous sea of responsibilities. The rock: vivid, strong, certain, sure. \nBeloved came the assurance.",
        "Good humour, running as a burbling current always through their interactions, the small interactions of friendship that took loyalty of vassal to lord and lord to vassal to some height beyond them as song was beyond speech.",
        "He heard the words. They were imprinted, he was sure, on his heart. Nothing had ever been so real as the words—except for the hands clasping his.",
        "“I will not fail you.”",
        "“Witness this, you people of the Vangavaye-ve. Cliopher Mdang of Tahivoa, whose island is Loaloa, whose dances are Aōteketētana, whose ancestral ship is the Ouvaye-ve, is our chosen Viceroy.”",
        "“I, Cliopher Mdang of the Vangavaye-ve, do swear upon my soul and my heart and my life that I will keep this world of yours safe while you are absent and return it hale to you when you are come home.”",
        "Cliopher knelt where he was, the tears streaming down his face, his hands in his Radiancy’s, the ember flaring softly in the shell cupped between them.",
        "Islander culture did not think it shameful to show strong emotions. It was, in fact, considered the mark of a strong soul, one to be admired, when beauty or love or grief could call forth such powerful response.",
        "“There is a story I have heard of three brothers, the sons of Vonou’a. One left to see what he could see on the other side of the horizon. One left to find his heart’s desire. And one left to sit at the feet of the Sun”",
        "“I am Cliopher Mdang of Tahivoa. My island is Loaloa. My dances are Aōteketētana.”",
        "“I am Mdang. I hold the fire: I do not run from its burn.”",
        "“Did you get married? It looked like you got married.”",
        "Cliopher heard the plinking cascades of his Radiancy’s harp, and felt his heart overflowing again with gratitude, that his family could make his Radiancy so happy, that he was so happy, that his Radiancy was happy, that his family was happy.",
        "“I feel it is a wasted day if I have not managed to discompose Kip at least once.”",
        "“Come, my friends, we shall announce an amnesty on Fitzroy Angursell’s music tonight, and let us make merry in honour of the great statesman with the music of the great outlaw. There is something delicious about the whole idea.”",
        "“You clasped shoulders, embraced, hugged, kissed, touched foreheads, bowed over your hands—I have not—Kip, I haven’t touched anyone! I don’t know how.” \n“Here, my lord,” he said, getting up and opening his arms slightly. “I will show you.”",
        "‘They mean the common and ordinary good of duty honourably fulfilled, of love occasionally accompanied by quarrels, of friendships that will not fail, of a home filled with laughter and music and family.’",
        "His Radiancy regarded him solemnly for a moment, then walked forward to embrace him. “I know you will keep Zunidh safe and sound for me,” his Radiancy said, leaning forward until his forehead touched Cliopher’s in the Islander greeting.",
        "He looked back at Cliopher. “No final words, Kip?” \nCliopher felt a great rush of endearment welling up. “Have fun.” \nAnd his Radiancy laughed as he set his face to the sun and stepped alone across the threshold of his Palace for the first time.",
        "And Cliopher with a singing heart began to explain the principles of the Great Plan, which he had developed from those fundamental teachings of the proper relations between people and communities he had long ago been taught from the Lays."

        "“That was when I knew. And I swore then I would always stand behind him, because I have never admired anyone so much as that moment. He had no choice to become emperor, you know. But he could have said no then, and he didn’t. He didn’t.”",
        "Cliopher closed his eyes. “I would have helped him, if he’d told me.”\n“You did help him,” Ludvic replied gently.",
        "So his lord was not what he’d thought—and so? He did not need to chase that viau, seek that sea, any longer. \nThere were other seas to seek, to find, to sail. He could be content with them.\n(All of this was a lie.)",
        "He might not be able to be the Last Emperor of Astandalas’ greatest friend—Fitzroy Angursell had his own great friends of the Red Company—but Cliopher had done his best in his Radiancy’s service. Done well in that service.",
        "His thoughts wandered once more to his Radiancy—to Fitzroy Angursell—and his poetry. Then he looked at the painter again, her warm smile, her intense eyes, the deliberate placement of her hand on his thigh, and he felt an answering stir.",
        "“Oh, you know—the passage connecting your rooms to his Radiancy’s.”\n“What passage? Where?”\nRhodin snickered. “Oh, don’t be coy! How else would you attend your secret assignations?”",
        "My friend—the Impostor, you know, my correspondent?”",
        "“I am trying,” Cliopher said, his voice coming soft. “I am trying so hard, Rhodin.”",
        "He had wanted to sail the Wide Seas with his Radiancy beside him, as Elonoa’a had sailed with Aurelius Magnus; he had wanted to find a new island, a new star, the currents that would open up the gates between worlds.",
        "“Aya and Jiano told us to...make wishes, to the bonfire. Did you ask for yourself?”\n“No,” he said plainly, if quietly.\nRhodin nodded, entirely unsurprised, and set his hand on the door. Before he opened it, he said: “You’re allowed to.”",
        "His Radiancy, Fitzroy Angursell, could come and go as he pleased, and if it did not please him to come, well, Cliopher had no claim on him beyond the service he had already offered, and the honours he had already received in return.",
        "“We—those of us who are seekers after the wisdom of the Merrions—use dinosaur, or sometimes you will hear saurian, when we are speaking of the hyperintelligent telepathic cousins of the brute thunder lizards.”",
        "What secrets did he yet hold in his heart that he himself had yet to uncover?",
        "“And if it is the case that he has received them, but for one reason or another has been unable to reply...I do not want him to think we have forgotten him.”",
        "He did not need to be embarrassed for...loving people, surely.\nAnd it was no secret that he was devoted to his Radiancy.",
        "“Cliopher...please.” It was extremely rare for any of his Islander friends to call him Cliopher. He looked sharply at Toucan. “Cliopher. We love you as you are. Let yourself be yourself.”",
        "The rest of us say that so long as there is a tanà to light the fire, our culture will never fail. The rest of the lore-keepers keep the old ways for us all, but the tanà shows us what it means to be an Islander.”",
        "Tanaea-te imalo! Moa’a-ki imalo! Kifa’ana imai? I bring a fire for your hearth! I bring news of the Wide Seas! Have you any problems for me?",
        "For the first time he wanted to go and not come back.\nBut of course he could not do that; not yet. His Radiancy had given him these reins of government to hold, and Cliopher knew his duty.",
        "One who holds the fire went as Elonoa’a went\nTo sit at the counsels of the emperors and speak for the people.",
        "His voice took on the familiar teasing tone, and Cliopher could—could not handle it.\n“Bertie,” he interrupted softly, “please. I...I can’t joke about him. Not...”",
        "Cliopher was drowning in an ocean of light.\nHe was far below the surface, in water that was not water, in light that was not light, in a sea that was not anything he had ever known.\nThere were voices singing.\nThe song was the song of the Lays.",
        "He was dying and if he did not now sing his name he would be lost, fall to the darkness below the luminous waters, fall into the oblivion where the Old Woman Who Lives in the Deeps would ingather him to her silent company.",
        "The door opened. Cliopher stood up politely, courteously, summoning his best court-impervious expression.\nKip Mdang walked in.",
        "“The man known as Fitzroy Angursell is in an oubliette in the Palace: what I have learned, what I know, is that he can still be freed.”",
        "His heart was hammering in his throat, with memory and desire and that hope for something he had never been able to say.",
        "“I,” Rhodin said proudly, “was informed by your younger self that I was the only aristocrat he’d ever encountered who was of any use whatsoever.”",
        "“Don’t follow Protocol 143.”",
        "His Radiancy was Fitzroy Angursell. He was everything Cliopher had always loved most from the wider empire, the great emperor-mage, the even greater revolutionary poet.\nHis friend.\n(That was another lie. There was another word.)",
        "Where had that poetry gone? Cliopher did not write like this any longer, did he? He did not search for such splendid metaphors. He had lifted the form of the bureaucratic report to an art; but at what cost?",
        "You took him there and yet he is not certain of you?\nHe must ask you to take his words as the words of a friend?\nHe must ask you to grant him that—\nI am angry again, not at what you gave up but what you have not yet claimed.",
        "How could you let him sail off alone on his adventure? Why is he travelling without you? If he was stolen away by the Sun and the Moon, you know what to do.",
        "He was the tanà. He Held the Fire. He did not run from its burn.\nHe felt singed.",
        "Cliopher had never been either fully of the court or fully at home. Too much one, too much the other, never enough of either to satisfy anyone.\nNo, that was unfair. It had satisfied his Radiancy.",
        "Cliopher remembered when it had been fun.\nChallenging, at any rate.\nHe did not miss those days.\nHe missed his Radiancy.",
        "I hope, I think, I dare to imagine you will not think less of me for saying it is harder than I thought to be once more in the world.",
        "Cliopher...\nI dare to write to you as a friend. Please...please accept it as if we sat together on the sandbar at Navikiani, far out in the lagoon, far from any ears, any guards, any need to guard ourselves.",
        "You gave me that gift back, too, didn’t you? That holiday on Lesuia where I was able to remember myself.\nWe never sat beside a fire together there, did we? Not just the two of us. We should have.",
        "—Your servant, in a manner of speaking.",
        "“Do not be afraid,” the Mother of the Mountains said. “You are surrounded by magic, by the love and esteem Lord Artorin bears for you, by all the protections his love and esteem have woven around you.”",
        "“I can see nothing but darkness...except that there is one tiny white thing...a shell, I think...very far in the distance.”",
        "The Mother of the Mountains looked up at him, her eyes full of magic, of wonder, of mystery. “And for the possibility of a tiny white shell,” she said, “you would face the certainty of darkness?”",
        "“It is a common and ordinary good.”\n“And for those,” the Mother of the Mountains said, “you have shown over and over again you would face any darkness and doubt.”\n“I would,” he said, for he always had.",
        "He could go home. But he didn’t want to.\nHe wanted that shell on the other side of the darkness.",
        "“After what happened at Woodlark...I was already almost-outcast. People knew why I’d done it, made those orders. They could...respect that someone had to. But they could not like me for it.”",
        "The two of them sat there, two hinterland tribesmen who had learned what they had to teach until the two of them could play their games better than any of them, and now sat there opposite each other, the Viceroy and the Commander in Chief of Zunidh.",
        "“You should go find your cousin. Go find him. Go find yourself.”",
        "“There are other people to hold your fire here,” Ludvic said, very seriously. “It will not go out because you have left it. It will stay lit because you have taught other people to tend it. Let them.”",
        "“The Mother of the Mountains said all she could see was darkness ahead of me.”\nLudvic raised his eyebrows at him, almost just as his Radiancy did. “All?”\nCliopher closed his eyes. “Darkness, and monsters, and a small, ordinary, common white shell.”",
        "His Radiancy. Fitzroy Angursell. A man who had resigned himself to being considered only a god, and never again known properly and fully for himself.",
        "“She gave me the beads. My father carved them, when he was still an apprentice to his father, before...My mother was the one to magic them. A gift for me, from—from both of them. And then she told me his name.”",
        "Masseo Ironhand, who shod the horses of the wind; who had made locks that could hold a shadow hostage; who had forged swords out of starlight.\nMaybe Masseo Umrit was worthy of having Ludvic for a son. Maybe. Cliopher would have to find out.",
        "“What if we meet up with danger?” Rhodin asked. “Robbers, for instance.”\nCliopher eyed the wicked steel implements laid out on the table with distaste. “Then I will talk us out of it, and if I cannot, then you will fight,” he said.",
        "Here, though, where everything was new and uncertain, Cliopher was struck anew both by Rhodin’s great competence and his deep strangeness.",
        "“It will be better when you know for certain,” Rhodin said quietly.\nCliopher swallowed. Sometimes he forgot how excellent a friend Rhodin was, really.",
        "The boy—his nephew, in all but the strictest definition—oh this was Basil’s son, it was!—opened his mouth and breathed the traditional words of greeting. “Tē ke’e’vina-tē zēnava parahë’ala!”",
        "“Basil,” Cliopher said, no longer easily, all the years of silence standing enormous in his throat. “Basil.”\n“Kip,” said Basil, equally hoarsely. “Kip.”",
        "Kip—I—I hoped that people at home were alive, I hoped that they’d survived the Fall, I thought they must have...but I didn’t...I couldn’t see how I could go home if you weren’t there.”",
        "He watched Clio splashing with his oars, scuttling across the calm, still water, the foreign trees around him, the very earth a different colour, and could only think that being a Wide Seas Islander also had to include this.",
        "And if he were humming Aurora as he worked—\nWell. At least he had started to recognize when he did so.\nAnd it wasn’t as if it weren’t the greatest work to so far come from the pen of the poet laureate of Zunidh, his dear friend.",
        "He could almost hear his Radiancy’s voice, laughter barely suppressed: “Hard at work, Lord Mdang?”\n“Always, my lord,” he replied out loud, and then chuckled quietly at himself for his fancies.",
        "“Cat got your tongue, Lord Mdang?” his Radiancy said, his voice as serene as it had ever been, but Cliopher was looking into his eyes and he could see the hesitation there, the all-too-human doubt, the hope—",
        "“My lord. My—Tor.” And then, as he came around the desk, and he did not know what to do besides that he could not, he must not, fall into that habitual formal prostration, his tongue ran away from him and he said, “Fitzroy Angursell.”",
        "“Fitzroy Angursell,” he said, the name like Basil’s ginger wine in his mouth. He let his right hand come up and rest upon his Radiancy’s hand, still holding onto his elbow, just as if he were an ordinary man, his friend.",
        "He gazed at his Radiancy, his friend, Fitzroy Angursell, his fanoa (oh, if only) and did not know what to say.",
        "“I’m fine,” he said. “Truly.”\nThere was nothing serene in his Radiancy’s eyes, face, voice. “Cliopher. Kip. You were caught in a landslide.”\n“Pikabe lost his arm.”\n“Pikabe isn’t here,” his Radiancy said, his eyes nearly liquid gold. “Nor is he you.”",
        "His Radiancy: the sun of his life, he had told Buru Tovo. He was burning more brightly before him than he ever had in all the pomp and majesty of his role as Sun-on-Earth.",
        "“Kip,” said his Radiancy, and made a vague beckoning gesture.\nCliopher obeyed out of impossibly long habit, impossibly deep regard.",
        "“I’m sorry I didn’t...”\n“You did everything,” his Radiancy replied immediately, and then there was a pause while they both failed to meet the other’s eye.",
        "“We’re basically in-laws at this point, aren’t we?”\nHis Radiancy held terrifically still.\n“I’m not certain Kip’s ready to say that,” his Radiancy said, but his hand was still on Cliopher’s shoulder, and Cliopher could feel how his fingers were trembling.",
        "She looked just as he had always imagined Ani would look, if the sea-goddess took human form. Copper-skinned, full-figured, even fat—‘generous as the whole width and depth of the Wide Seas,’ whispered a line from an old, old song.",
        "“Oh my dear friend!” Sardeet Avramapul cried, bouncing out of her seat and granting Rhodin a smile beyond metaphor. “Can it be? My dear friend! My correspondent! My penpal! My heart!”\nHis Radiancy, beside Cliopher, actually murmured, “Astonishing.”",
        "Sardeet laughed. Cliopher was slightly surprised that flowers did not start blooming at the sound.",
        "He kept his knee pressed against Cliopher’s, who wished fruitlessly and furiously that he had been able to offer any such comfort in the past.",
        "Cliopher admired her beauty, but he could not stop himself from thinking of the light in his Radiancy’s eyes when Cliopher had finally called him by his name.",
        "“Now, now, Kip, this is serious. I gave him the room next to yours, but do I need to tell him that there was a problem and you need to share?”\nThat was—that was—“That’s not true.”",
        "His Radiancy should not have looked at him like that, with his Fitzroy Angursell smile and the depth of meaning that their long acquaintanceship had given them. Cliopher’s face was tight and hot and he gripped his oboe, unable to muster the proper decorum.",
        "Cliopher could not let himself name, let alone articulate, what he was feeling, for he would go up in flames as the driest tinder under a spark from two striking rocks.",
        "You’re allowed to stop, the Mother of the Mountains had told him. But Cliopher had never been allowed to stop, never allowed himself to stop, never dared to stop.",
        "His Radiancy, Fitzroy Angursell, had a wicked look in his eyes. A challenging look; a dare.\nIt was like that, was it?",
        "The book of censored poetry was the only thing he’d ever stolen from the Palace.\nWell. Except for the government, of course.",
        "There was the gleam in his Radiancy’s eyes—still a touch wicked, but more appreciative, almost hilarious—and there were the strange harmonies of oboe and harp, and there was song after song after song.",
        "There had been a single note in there, the first time Cliopher had received anything like a personal note from his Radiancy.\n‘Ah, you found it! Well done. Always going above and beyond.’",
        "“You're Uncle Kip’s—” Cliopher coughed, and Clio gave him a strange look, then continued, “fanoa.”\nHe just said it.\nCliopher was simply speechless. Clio had just said it, as if it were easy, as if it were normal, as if it were a common and ordinary thing.",
        "“You are in the company of Fitzroy Angursell. What’s the worst that could happen?”",
        "“The other meaning is...archaic.”\n“I like archaic words,” his Radiancy murmured, stopping in the very middle of the stream.\n“So do I,” Cliopher admitted.",
        "He made to let go of his Radiancy’s hand, but his Radiancy was having none of it.\nHis Radiancy, Fitzroy Angursell, was a great mage and had been on many strange adventures. If he wanted to keep holding hands...\nCliopher held hands.",
        "He stared up at the tall palm. Was he thirsty enough to climb it?\nAfter a long, reluctant moment he decided that even if he wasn’t, his Radiancy would be.",
        "No one—not even Fitzroy Angursell—had ever wanted to write a song about his postal system reforms.",
        "The fanoa who had been Cliopher’s image and dream and ideal of friendship his entire life long.\nThey had been making love in the surf.\nThey were not—\nThat was not what fanoa meant. It couldn’t be. It couldn’t be.",
        "Cliopher had a bare moment of astonishment at realizing that his Radiancy—Fitzroy—was speaking Islander.\nA little haltingly, with hesitation, but...Islander. Islander!",
        "He felt sick with loss, as if his heart had been pierced and all his wistful dreams had gushed out of it, disappearing into the sand below their feet.",
        "People understood the idea that a lover might follow his beloved anywhere. It had always been a strange and difficult idea that one might love a friend that deeply.",
        "Cliopher said, very precisely, “You are known as the greatest of friends.” Fanoa, fanoa, fanoa. The word lingered in his mouth, the taste of it so beautiful on his tongue. He took a breath. “I shall be glad to take home the truth of your relationship.",
        "The ancient tanà said, “You say that very confidently. You do not think it will be hard to change something that has stood for so many centuries?”\nCliopher could not resist a glance at his Radiancy. They simultaneously burst out laughing.",
        "“It’s been a great consolation and encouragement to me on my recent travels. The knowledge that you could spend so long and so much of your life at court, in the Service, and yet when the challenges came you can step up to them with the whole of yourself.”",
        "“As you started to claim your culture more publicly, as we became closer friends, I conceived the idea that I wanted to...surprise you. Make it a gift.”\nCliopher stopped and regarded him, speechless.\n“I did surprise you,” Fitzroy said smugly.",
        "“Come, will you sing with me if I play? I’ve wanted—\nHe stopped, and smiled crookedly without finishing the thought.\nThere had been so many years when they could have been such better friends.\n“So have I,” he said, and left everything else unsaid.",
        "“You’ve been together long?” Aurelius asked.\nFitzroy’s hand gripped Cliopher’s shoulder tightly for a moment. “Yes,” Fitzroy said, his voice warm, clear, strong as the brilliant waters of Sky Ocean. “Half our lives.”",
        "“He danced the fire in the throne room of the Palace of Stars,” Fitzroy said, too proudly for Cliopher to parse. “It was one of the three most magnificent things I have ever seen”",
        "“They have done so much already for Auri...They must be tired...”\n‘Resentful’ hovered in the air between them, unspoken.\n“They came for their own reasons,” Cliopher said. “They stay for love.”",
        "“Jullanar said it was important before you do laundry. Don’t you check your pockets first?”\n“I’ve never done my own laundry.”\n“What? Jullanar said—never mind!”",
        "“I have never been to the House of Sun. I am Cliopher Mdang of Tahivoa, tanà of Zunidh and Hands of the Emperor, and I will go there and bring you the flame you need.”",
        "“I talked to the Mother of the Mountains. She told me that a great mage’s attention tangles magic around one. That your attention and...regard...had drawn magic around me.”\n“My love,” Fitzroy said, very quietly.",
        "“I don’t want to leave you,” Cliopher said helplessly, a truth he could not keep silent.\nFitzroy’s voice came out in a thin, hard tone, very unlike him. “I don’t want you to go.”",
        "“I hate seeing people go,” Fitzroy said, and his voice was flat, dispirited, defeated. “Always...always. I had to give the orders, and they go, and so often they do not come back...”\n“I will come back.”\n“You cannot promise me that.”\n“I always have.”",
        "“The Mother of the Mountains told me there was darkness before me, in the depths, in the heights, if I did not turn back.”\nFitzroy was silent for a long time.\n“Why didn’t you turn back, Kip?”\n“She said she saw a shell on the other side,” he whispered.",
        "“What a song I shall write of this,” Fitzroy added, in a low voice, when Cliopher looked down once more at the pot in his hands. “Of you.”",
        "“East first,” he murmured, his breath warm and sweet on Cliopher’s face. “Then west and home. Come home to me, Kip. Come home.”",
        "Once, so silently he did not know if he were awake or dreaming, a pure white fin whale surfaced beside him. She was enormous: it seemed to take forever as the long forehead crested the water until an eye, dark and wise and curious, looked at him.",
        "He followed the Ancestors, yes, but—\nBut he would not be himself if he did not help the needy before him, if he could do anything about it. It did not matter if it made the voyage longer, harder, more perilous—",
        "“The sea turtles are lore-keepers! Honour them!”",
        "He did not need to land. Theoretically he could keep sailing, past this island, into the silent reaches of Sky Ocean.\nSailing past was not how the story went.\nIt did not, in fact, make a good story.",
        "He was Cliopher Mdang of Tahivoa, tanà of the world, and he had a commission from his emperor to fulfill.",
        "No doubt if he were a proper hero on a quest, he would have somehow or other made friends with a finch or a mouse or a whole family of uncannily wise birds who would be delighted to do the sorting for him.\nFitzroy would have made such a friend.",
        "He started sorting the kernels by colour.\nThis was, he might have admitted to Fitzroy, something he actually enjoyed.",
        "He was entirely in her power. She had only to speak the word, and he would be one of those white-masked black boobies, muttering over their follies on the islets that followed after the sea-witch’s home. One word, and he would be undone, lost forever.",
        "“Such a handsome man,” she murmured, her hand rather lower than Cliopher liked, from a sea-witch so early in the morning.",
        "“Always liked you, Kip Mdang,” Vou’a repeated. “A fool, mind you, but what’s life without a little folly? You’ll catch your viau one day, if you keep chasing.”",
        "He had always thought there was more down there, in his heart, where he had never gone.",
        "(And what was the Protocol for blindly plumbing the depths of a cave that was somehow also his heart, on an island far into Sky Ocean?)",
        "He crawled, wriggled, abased himself in the darkness.\n There was, he told himself through gritted teeth, ashamed of his weakness, a shell on the other side. A common, ordinary good: his.",
        "Was this really the store of secrets he had never shared?\nThey were not worthy of the gift he wanted Vou’a to give to Ani. They were not worthy of an epic song by Fitzroy Angursell. They were not worthy of who he, Cliopher Mdang, wanted to be.\nWho he was.",
        "Fitzroy was his beloved not because he was the Sun-on-Earth or the great poet, but because he was funny, and intelligent, and sorrowful, and because he loved.",
        "It came down to this: did he trust Vou’a, trickster-god, Son of Laughter, to have spoken the truth? That there was, deep in his heart, a worthy gift?",
        "He was beyond panic. If he died here, here in the dark, drowning in the dark water, it would be the fulfillment of a lifetime of nightmares. He had always feared he would die by drowning.",
        "He would not stop despite his hatred of diving. He would not stop despite his fear of drowning. He would not stop when the storms capsized him again and again.\nHe would not stop here, in this black depth. He wanted to know what was on the other side.",
        "Is this where you stop?\nNo. He made that promise to himself, as he had made it so many times. No, and no, and no. This was not where he stopped.\nHis fanoa was waiting for him, on the other side of the dark.",
        "For a moment it burned, and then his tears fell upon it, and in a great upwelling of steam the coal went out and left, in the palm of his hand, the second half of a common, ordinary, simple white shell.",
        "“This is the best of you, Cliopher Mdang. Are you truly willing to give it up?”\n“It is the best of what I have been, not who I will be, Buru Vou’a,” he replied, “and I do not lose the fire by giving it to another.”",
        "Cliopher took a deep breath, as if he were diving for nefalao—as if he were diving into the dark water at what he hoped was not the bottom of his heart—and then he took the rope in one hand, stepped over to the outrigger, and deliberately capsized his boat",
        "Cliopher could be patient, terrifyingly patient, but—\n He started to grow perhaps the triflingest bit irritated.",
        "He was Cliopher Mdang of Tahivoa. His island was Loaloa. His dances were Aōteketētana. He was the tanà of the world and the Hands of the Emperor, and he was on a quest.",
        "He nurtured a fine and splendid flame of righteous fury in his heart as he climbed all the way up to the open front door of the House of the Sun.\nHe didn’t bother knocking. His hands were full.",
        "Honestly, it was as if the Sun wasn’t even trying.",
        "He was himself, and he would not be made lesser, not though he stood at the feet of the Sun.",
        "The Sun flung up his hands in a sudden exasperation. “What do you want? I will give you a boon, if only you tell me how you came here without my knowledge!”\nCliopher smiled.",
        "He would know his Fitzroy’s resonant laugh anywhere.",
        "Cliopher could not resist, and passed through the crew of the He’eanka to his lord, his friend, his fanoa.\nThis time he did not hesitate; this time he reached out and embraced him first, as tightly as he had ever held onto anything.\n“Kip,” Fitzroy breathed",
        "“Shh,” said Fitzroy, rubbing his hand gently down Cliopher’s hair. “Shh. You are home safe.”",
        "“We must go find her, Kip. I dreamed of someone, in that tower at the edge of the Abyss—”\nCliopher’s heart might melt, if it were ice instead of fire.\n“She might not be your heir.”\n“She might be my daughter,” Fitzroy replied, “My family. My very own.”",
        "The night fell, and other stars came out, unfamiliar constellations that here could be sailed to, could be reached, could prove themselves to be places out of myth.",
        "Cliopher had fallen hand-in hand with a wild mage, a great poet, a legendary hero: together they had fallen out of the Nine Worlds and into the heart of the sky.",
        "“For a thing to be alive,” Tupaia said, “it must change and grow.”",
        "“Fair winds and fair seas, and an island full of all you need when you are ready to land,” Elonoa’a said.\n“And to you,” Fitzroy replied for them both, his voice thick. “And to you.”",
        "What dance did they do here, in this place where time was meaningless because all the markers of time had their own beings?",
        "Cliopher was sure she could see into him. He did not mind: he had loved the constellation with all the love he had ever given that small toy, and he would open his heart to her.",
        "“Even at your most obsequious—” Fitzroy started to laugh. “Your most obsequious lasted all of an hour, that second day you were my secretary.”\n“After I looked you in the eyes.”\n“After you corrected my pronunciation, capped my joke, and...saved me.”",
        "“For so long all I had was that morning ritual, of you looking at me and saying ‘good morning’ when I looked at you and said ‘good morning’—that was it, Cliopher, that was all I had to remind myself that I was a person, a human being, a man.”",
        "“I knew the first chamber could not be all there was to me,” he said, still looking at the sky. He squeezed Fitzroy’s hand. “I knew because my love for you was not there.”",
        "“Do you ever dream about kissing?”",
        "Cliopher had never, not once, imagined that Fitzroy found him attractive.",
        "He had wanted to be chosen, to be equal, to be the other half of the shell that was half-formed by Fitzroy. He had not wanted...sex.",
        "El and Auri had made love in the foam at the edge of the sea, the air full of magic, as if they were the night and the day giving form to the lights of the sky.",
        "Cliopher had...literally never entertained this idea before.",
        "“Fitzroy,” he said, hoarsely.\n“Yes, my lord Mdang,” Fitzroy said, his voice so much his Radiancy’s that Cliopher dropped all the husks from suddenly nerveless fingers.\nNo. He would not let this happen. They had travelled too far together to return to that.",
        "Cliopher had taken the most precious thing he had ever held and dropped it.",
        "The great poet, whom Cliopher loved so very much, but not...apparently not in the right way. He had always loved things too much or not enough or in the wrong way.",
        "He had never loved anyone as he loved Fitzroy.",
        "Cliopher leaned forward, obedient to the touch, his hand gripping Fitzroy’s other hand, steadying himself. Fitzroy did have beautiful eyes, and long eyelashes, gently curved.",
        "“I liked being close to you,” he said. “If you’d still like to...” Fitzroy hitched his breath, his eyes widening and then narrowing with speculation. He smiled, a crooked, imperfectly, beautifully human smile as he lifted his hand.",
        "What greater intimacy could sex possibly give? He had not magically become more intimate with Suzen—or even with Ghilly—because they’d had sex. It didn’t work like that.\nIt didn’t work like that for Cliopher.",
        "Cliopher did not know what to say. He had been so happy last night. He had wanted that for so long...and it had been just what he’d imagined.\nWhat he’d imagined. Not what Fitzroy had. Not what Fitzroy had wanted.",
        "He had wanted someone who was his, and who would choose him, as his equal, his match, his outrigger, as so much more than friend.",
        "He was not Aurelius, whose magic stirred the sky. He was not Elonoa’a, who could hear the winds whisper of far islands. He was not Fitzroy fucking Angursell, who had written the best poem of an age.",
        "“I am misunderstanding something. Talk to me—please. I’m trying but—I’m making things worse—Please. Set me right! You’ve never hesitated before. Don’t let me spoil everything.”",
        "Cliopher said nothing, only wept, his face buried in his hands. He could not bear any witness to his folly and his heartbreak, the death of this dream.",
        "He shook his head at the imperative, dumb with grief, wishing he could howl his emotions in a song or a rising wind, a storm, a wave, a great tumult.",
        "“Cliopher,” Fitzroy said quietly, “what does fanoa mean to you?”\nHe could not answer. His whole life stood in his throat.",
        "Fitzroy hesitated, as if he faced a precipice and did not dare step out.\nNo.\nFitzroy Angursell cared nothing for falling.\nHe hesitated as if he were going to have to put himself back in the cage.",
        "“I thought that was what you wanted,” Fitzroy said. “And what I...I wanted it, too. I wanted to...Kip, I thought...I’ve misunderstood something. What does it mean? You’re so quiet about this...it’s so important to you. I want to know. Please.”",
        "“That’s not how the Lays use it for them,” he said, very quietly. “It means...what we say it means...what I always thought it meant...is...someone you love so deeply you would leave the world to sail Sky Ocean for them.”",
        "“A relationship like Vou’a and Ani have. Vou’a raised up the islands for Ani. She brought forth all the living creatures for him. The greatest of friends, we say, thought that’s thin. A euphemism. Fanoa means the person who is worth...everything.”",
        "“It had always been so important to me that in the stories they were not lovers. That two people could love each other like that, but it didn’t need to be about sex. That you could find someone who was your match. Your other half. You’re equal.”",
        "“It’s not as if anyone uses the word. Fanoa, that is. In its social meaning. No one else will have...lost anything. They’ve all always thought me a fool for taking that meaning. Chasing a viau.” He swallowed, forced out: “It’s very old-fashioned.”",
        "It was not fair that Fitzroy was looking at him even more softly, more tenderly, his face full of something that almost seemed like wonder.",
        "Fitzroy said, still very softly, very gently: “You think of me as your equal?”\nIt was not really a question. Cliopher did not have to answer it. He spoke anyway. “I do.”",
        "“Your equal. Your match. Your...mirror, even? To bring in a Shaian conceit. The other shoe. The outrigger.” His voice warmed with something like humour, and he squeezed Cliopher’s hands. “Your other hand.”",
        "“Why does it matter what Auri and El made of it?”\nCliopher stared at him. His heart hurt. \n“We are not Aurelius Magnus and Elonoa’a. We are ourselves. Fitzroy and Cliopher.”",
        "Fitzroy smiled. His eyes were full of joy and hope and relief, because this meant they were not alone, this meant they were good enough, this meant they could choose each other.\nHis friend’s eyes. His fanoa’s eyes.\nPlease—",
        "“Cliopher, Kip, you are my right hand, my outrigger, my mirror that shows me my better side. My people do not have a word for this, but yours do.”",
        "“Ask me,” Fitzroy whispered. “Ask me so I can say yes.”",
        "Then Cliopher spoke, his quiet words falling clear as water drops. “You are my fanoa. My beloved. My own. Will you let me be yours?”\n“Not let,” said Fitzroy. “You are. You are.”",
        "“Goodness, my lord Mdang, you say that as if I did not fall half in love with you on sight.” And then he smiled, lifted Cliopher’s hands to his lips, and said: “Yes.” His voice was raw, husky, certain. “Yes. Let’s go home, Kip.”",
        "Cliopher drew in a deep, forceful breath, pushing against the panic and fear wanting to rise in his gorge. He would trust in Fitzroy’s magic. He would.\nThis time he was not falling alone; neither of them were.",
        "What was he supposed to say, if Fitzroy told him he really was a god?\nHe wasn’t. Cliopher knew that. And even if he were...well, Buru Tovo loved a god, in person and as a person, and was loved in return. It could be done.",
        "“It was simpler up there, wasn’t it?”\n“Simple as the most important things. It’s like living inside a poem.” Fitzroy gave him one of those sly, wry, glinting grins. “Which even I can find tedious eventually.”",
        "“Trust me,” Fitzroy said, smiling like the sunrise, like all the lost magic and wonder of Sky Ocean, like the embers of sunlight burning in the fire-pot. “If my fanoa is so fantastically competent, I can’t be entirely useless.”",
        "“I was wondering,” Fitzroy said after a moment, “whether there was a special efela for fanoa.”",
        "Fitzroy shifted position, lifted up a wooden comb with four widely-spaced teeth, and asked, quite neutrally, “Would you like me to comb your hair?”",
        "Cliopher wanted to feel nervous about explaining this, but his fanoa’s hands were gentle on his hair, untangling the knots, reforming the braids, and all Cliopher could think of was the long years of devoted service and loving patronage.",
        "“I couldn’t put anyone in this position. No matter how necessary the good for the many. I couldn’t.” He was silent for a moment, looking at the beautiful antique furnishings. “And how many people died in the Fall because I couldn’t?”",
        "“If I die first,” he said, “cremate me and keep the ashes until—until—until they can be scattered with yours. So you can be free but you don’t have to be—alone—we can sail with the Ancestors together—”",
        "He almost wished they had the Empire of Astandalas back, simply so they could destroy it even more thoroughly.",
        "And knowing where he was, where he had been, he knew exactly how to go home at last.",
        "“It is my hair and I shall wear it precisely as I wish. Which at the moment, is how you’ve done it.”",
        "“What is he going to do, Kip?” Fitzroy whispered. “Ludvic’s always been so ... steady. Ever since I woke up after the Fall, he’s been there, no matter what. He’s so loyal. How can I face him and tell him that the emperor he loved was a—How can I tell him?”",
        "“You tell him the truth. You are Fitzroy Angursell and you are also Artorin Damara.”\n“That name means nothing to me.”\nAlthough that could not possibly be true—there was far too much venom in his tone for it to be true—Cliopher left it alone.",
        "“Ludvic loves you, not the Emperor.”\n“You don’t know that.”\n“He told me.”\nThat silenced Fitzroy, who knew as well as Cliopher that Ludvic far preferred saying nothing to lying.",
        "Cliopher looked at the basket containing the mirimiri of Ani, the shimmering cloth so subtle and fine his hands could barely hold it, his eyes barely see it, and he shivered with a deep fear and wonder at what he might waken.",
        "He cleared his throat. “If you wish to be his Radiancy—”\n“No. I—I can’t, Kip. Not yet.”\nNot ever was obvious in the sudden distress in his eyes.",
        "“Kip, we both have plenty of flame pearls. I’d rather have a thousand common, ordinary white clamshells strung together than all the jewels in my treasury, because we could find those together.”",
        "“You don’t have to prove anything. Not to me, not to your Buru Tovo—who is immensely proud of you—not to Elonoa’a—not to Tupaia—not to anyone.”",
        "Fitzroy leaned forward and rested his forehead on his, just for a moment, and then he whispered, “Don’t drown yourself to make a point, Cliopher Mdang. You don’t need to be anything but who you are.”",
        "“Oh, come on,” Fitzroy said in Shaian once they had settled down with their coconuts and were waiting for Haunui to come around. “That was hilarious. I love how your cousins occasionally faint with surprise. It’s most gratifying.”",
        "“I find that unfathomable,” Fitzroy declared. “My family tree looks like a cordon-pruned fruit tree, whereas yours is like one of those vines that runs underground as well as overground, and pops up in all sorts of strange places.”",
        "“Don’t put your hand in the water,” Cliopher said in exasperation when he saw his friend preparing to reach down. “Those sharks will take it for a fish if you’re not careful.”\n“Well—”\n“No.”\nFitzroy laughed and obediently sat up. “Spoilsport.”",
        "“You can do this,” Fitzroy murmured softly. “You’ve been to the House of the Sun. Own it.”",
        "“Tovo always has said that you’d come back when it was time,” the old man said. “I should know better than to wager against him.”",
        "“I think,” Fitzroy said, his voice very low, and yet...certain, too, “that you have tried very hard to be of use, Kip. You give and give and give so that you can feel as if you are part of things, don’t you?”",
        "“What a thought,” Fitzroy murmured, holding himself very still for a moment. Cliopher settled himself down on the deck, facing where his friend (his fanoa) leaned against the mast. “The idea,” he went on, “that we could do something because we wanted to.”",
        "“I’ve had one hot bath since we left Basil’s inn. Washing with a bucket of water in your ancestral village was fine, I guess, but it’s not—it’s not the same. You know what I mean, don’t you? Conju is going to despair over my skin. It’s peeling, Kip.”",
        "“Cliopher. Cliopher Mdang. Kip. What is my area of expertise?”\n“High drama.”\nFitzroy nodded judiciously. “Exactly.”\n“I don’t think my story needs any more drama than it already has, Fitzroy.”\n“Kip! Honestly, this is why Ylette and I had to dress you.”",
        "“Cliopher, trust me. You are worthy, and you deserve to be seen for the brilliant man you are. Your people are waiting for you to step up and take your place. It’s time.”",
        "“Kip, let me help you. I’m your fanoa, am I not? Your mirror and your match, your equal? The other keel of your vaha, your other hand, the other half of the shell?”",
        "“Well then,” Fitzroy said. “You don’t need to be something other than you are, Kip. You just need to be fully yourself.” His voice went soft. “Both halves, Kip. The carefully contained embers and the blazing fire.”",
        "“He’s your Buru Tovo, too. It’s not really a familial title...and even if it were your—you’d still be allowed.”",
        "“Vinyë’s made friends with my sister Melissa? How wonderful! What a splendid thing, Kip—the idea of Conju and your mother and your sister and your niece...”",
        "He looked at Fitzroy, who was watching him intently. “Would you light it for me, Fitzroy?”\nFitzroy drew in a sharp breath. “Kip. You can’t mean that.”\nCliopher did not know if he could smile, but he nodded. His voice was hoarse. “Please.”",
        "The wood caught, and crackled, and for a moment Cliopher touched the fire, as he had always wanted to touch it, as if it were a living thing tame to his hand.",
        "“Because it’s a tower?”",
        "Was that still an issue? Was what Cliopher had offered not enough, after all? Should he ask?\nBut Fitzroy was smiling again, pleased with the space, the house, and...and he would say something, wouldn’t he? If he wanted—",
        "“Will you be my ke’e, Cliopher Mdang?”\n“As you are mine,” Cliopher said. “My fanoa.”",
        "“You will show me how to love this tower, won’t you?”",
        "“It was Saya Dorn’s shrine,” Cliopher said intently. “Not mine. Never mine.”",
        "“I promise you,” he said softly, “that particular painting matters to me because it is the one that told me the ke’ea of my life. Not for any other reason.”",
        "“Kip, there is an iguana in the bathhouse. No—let me rephrase that. There is an iguana in the bath. My bath. With me. An iguana.”",
        "“There you are, Cousin Kip, your boss thinks you should let me have agency and personal judgment in order to prevent the collapse of society.”",
        "“Sunset’s a bit later than the Palace...Don’t get lost?”\n“I could find you anywhere,” Fitzroy said softly.”",
        "Fitzroy scuttled over and embraced him fiercely. “There’s no shame,” he whispered, “in loving something, however big, however small.”",
        "“I didn’t think it was anything to be ashamed of. I thought it was something rather fine, in fact.”",
        "“Perhaps we should reconsider, if it’s not something you feel can be announced. I’ve had enough of being a secret.”",
        "“Fitzroy,” he said, looking into his eyes. “I saw you. You could have told me at any point and I would have believed you, wholly and utterly.”",
        "“You know what it is to have a truth too big, too real, too much the ground of your soul. That is what I feel for you, for calling you my fanoa.”",
        "“I’m sorry I’m...like this. Too much, and not enough.” He managed a shaky laugh. “I always have been, you know.”\nFitzroy’s thumbs moved against his cheeks. “So have I,” he said softly. “Fanoa, you know.”",
        "He gently tugged on Cliopher’s head, and they touched their foreheads together. “The other half of your heart.”\n“I am the other half of yours,” Cliopher said.",
        "“You know, I’m lying here thinking, ‘What would Jullanar do?’ But the answer is ‘healthy communication’ and ‘ask useful questions.’”\n“We’re doomed,” said Cliopher without missing a beat, and was gratified when Fitzroy laughed properly, out loud.",
        "“I refuse to trap you. I refuse to hold you here. I refuse to bind you, even with my love. It is—I want it to be—a gift. Freely offered.”\nFitzroy squeezed his hand back. “Freely taken,” he said, very quietly.",
        "“I used to be the solid, staid, responsible bureaucrat of bureaucrats, who could be trusted with the world’s government.”\n“You’ve never been that boring,” Fitzroy returned, “and I would still trust you with the world.”",
        "“Do you want to go?” Cliopher pushed himself up onto one elbow and looked at his fanoa frankly. “Fitzroy. Do you want to?”\nSlowly, Fitzroy nodded. “Yes. Kip. Yes.”",
        "“Rhodin is going to be so pleased with this development,” Fitzroy declared, extending his hand to see if the lizard would sniff it. The iguana ignored him entirely, even when he stroked its side with a gentle finger. “Our very own household lizard.”",
        "“You saw me,” he whispered. “I would have lost myself, Kip. I was so close to just letting myself float away.”",
        "“O gods, Kip, I have two legal identities, and neither of them are truly me.”",
        "“I didn’t know how to do anything else. I was locked in my fucking tower like that Marwn who died and I was supposed to have died there, like she did, nothing but a vessel for the Empire.”",
        "Cliopher hugged him more tightly, and then thought better of it and kissed him on the top of his bent head, in a part of the spiralling hair.\nFitzroy shuddered convulsively, and clutched at his hand.",
        "“When I look at you—whenever I’ve looked at you—I’ve never seen only a mask and nothing underneath it.”\n“That can’t be true,” Fitzroy scoffed.\n“It is,” he said, quietly, intensely.",
        "“The man who met my eyes when I made a joke and capped it? The man who asked me to be Viceroy with a terrible prank about the Duke of Ikiano? The man who vocally forbade Ylette to dress me in satin or the colour olive, in front of multiple people?”",
        "“The man who cared so much for his people he was willing to stay in a cage until he was sure they were free? The man who learned Islander in secret just to please me? The man who always, always, always listened to me?”",
        "“I can only ask you the questions, and listen to your answers.”\n“Kip, don’t...Kip, I can’t...”\n“You can,” he said relentlessly, as confidently as he had crossed Sky Ocean, as he had climbed that long stair, as he had lived in the world. “You must.”",
        "“You believed me, didn’t you, that there was a six-foot iguana in the bath-house.”\nThat was an unexpected sequitur, but Cliopher went with it. “Of course.”\n“People don’t, you know. Believe me when I tell such a strange and ridiculous truth as that.”",
        "“Pali said—”\n“Pali Avramapul strikes me as a person who does not like to feel confused and guilty.”",
        "“That sounds like more of what-would-Jullanar-do,” Cliopher said. “The useful questions and healthy communication and so on.”\n“She’s appalling.” Fitzroy’s voice dropped. “I wish she were here.”",
        "“Do you think Pali or Sardeet or Jullanar or Masseo love you any less than my sister or my cousin Basil love me?” Cliopher interrupted gently. “They want you to be happy, Fitzroy, and they thought you were before.”",
        "“Many of us have a more fragile happiness in our twenties than we would like anyone else to know.”",
        "“I know you don’t like that title, but it was always an endearment. No one outside your household called you that. It is a name of love and respect.”",
        "“I’ll be the best fanoa, you’ll see.”\nCliopher grinned. “You do have some unusually stiff competition there—”\n“I cannot believe you’re making dick jokes about Auri and El.”",
        "“Vou’a raised up the islands for Ani,” Cliopher said, laughing.\nFitzroy turned to him, face stern. “And you don’t think I, Fitzroy Angursell, can come up with something equally impressive? They may be gods but I am your favourite poet.”",
        "“Does it hurt?”\n“Nothing to speak of.”\n“Nonsense,” Fitzroy said, with a sly smile, and he lifted Cliopher’s hand to his lips. “I’ll kiss it better for you.”",
        "“Who are you?” he whispered again. He held a fire in his hand, that living fire his fanoa had made for him, held between their clasped hands. “Ask me again,” Fitzroy said, “A third time, Kip. Ask me the questions.”",
        "“Beloved,” he said, “what is your name?”\nAnd all the world stopped.\nThe whale vanished below the surface; the viau settled in the hollow troughs of the waves; the waves themselves did not crash upon the stones, but were still.",
        "“My name,” his fanoa said, solid as the earth, “is Fitzroy Angursell.”",
        "“Are you doing this,” he whispered, his hand clenching around Fitzroy’s in atavistic terror.\n “I am not,” replied Fitzroy, with exhilaration in his voice. “We are being invited.”",
        "“Do you trust me, Cliopher Mdang?”\n“I do,” said Cliopher, for he did; he did.\n“This is a song, a story, a legend for us. For us.”\n“I trust you.”\n“I can take us down there by magic, if you will let me?”\n“I trust you. Yes.”",
        "“Come with me,” Fitzroy said, his voice suddenly warm, delighted, enticing—as enticing as every story—as that picture had been—\nAnd then he was dissolving, his bones and flesh falling away, his hands no longer grasping anything but air—\nAnd he was flying.",
        "Cliopher found his voice. “That was...was...matter for a song.”\nFitzroy smiled at him, slow and secret, his delight welling as slowly as the light. “Yes. One day.”\n“I will help you,” Cliopher promised.",
        "“I’ve discovered something, Kip.”\n“Have you?”\n“I want to have adventures with you for the rest of my life.”",
        "A flicker of an eyebrow, and all Cliopher’s fear evaporated. Fitzroy would keep him safe; or they would fight the dark and the cold together. Hand in hand, as Ani and Vou’a had once walked, the shoreline and the sea.",
        "“You’re so beautiful,” Cliopher blurted, and when Fitzroy gave him an incredulous look, refused to do anything but be as earnest as his heart wished. “With the shell in your hand and the magic in your face and your...your...everything...”",
        "“Let us walk in legends, Kip Mdang.”\nCliopher’s heart was hammering. “Yes,” he breathed. “Yes. What—What is your island, Fitzroy Angursell?”\n“This one.” Fitzroy dropped his hands.\nThe fire at the heart of the world rose up.",
        "He gripped the shell in his hand, himself held safe by his fanoa, and he looked up at the golden eyes so full of magic, so full of brilliant intellect and indomitable will, so full of the fundamental joy of creation.",
        "Fitzroy knew what he was doing. He was smiling, and he was raising the fire around them, and he was the rock that held fast, and the sun and the stars in the sky, and Cliopher was as safe in his arms as Fitzroy had ever been in his.",
        "He stared at Fitzroy, whose face was exhilarated, dazzling as the sun, and he thought that he had thought he could not love that man any more, and he had been wrong.",
        "Fitzroy had made the world a place where this could happen.\n“Thank you,” Cliopher said, dazed, unable to do anything but smile.\n“You’re welcome,” Fitzroy replied with a royal graciousness, and then his lips twitched.",
        "The serenity dissolved into a purely, gloriously human joy. “Kip! Look what I just did!”\n“You made an island.”\n“I made an island.”\nThey grinned at each other, each as astonished by the magnitude of Fitzroy’s daring as a person could be.",
        "Fitzroy was dazzled with his magic, smiling with such power in him that Cliopher felt that inner flame rise up just a little further. He said, “Fitzroy. You made me an island.”",
        "He could only grab onto Fitzroy and embrace him as tightly as Fitzroy had held him, rising up out of the depths of the sea, tears running freely from his eyes in pure, singing joy.",
        "“Not even Auri ever made an island for El,” Cliopher said.\n“I thank you to remember that we are not Auri and El, and we are setting our own grand example—exemplar, even—for those who come after us.”",
        "“You made me an island.”\nHis fanoa’s eyes were sparkling like the sea. “I did.” And then, with a small, brilliant grin. “Not just for you.”\n“You made us an island.”",
        "Fitzroy lifted his half-shell up against the sun. “Look at this colour. Scarlet and a subtle gold.”\n“Fire and the Red Company,” Cliopher said. His heart could not take much more of this, surely?",
        "“What—what is your island?” Cliopher smiled at him, just a little, just enough.\n“My island is Loaloa. What is yours?”\nFitzroy drew in a deep breath, and his voice was full of joy. “My island is Navanoa.”\n“Perfect,” Cliopher breathed.",
        "“Don’t ask me the third question,” Fitzroy said, as Cliopher was about to turn his head to do so. “I don’t have a clever answer for it yet.”",
        "One day that would be a beach, and his descendants would run their boats up to this island, this Navanoa, with a line or two from the Lays in their mouths.\nA new star in the sky, and a new island in the Ring.\nIt was impossible, and yet it was true.",
        "He did not even care that they had no food or fresh water or shade or shelter or means of leaving. They had a new island and a pair of shells for the first beads on their efanoa, and...and that was enough",
        "“I—we—Fitzroy and I—my lord, that is, but—no, he’s my fanoa—we sailed Sky Ocean to the House of the Sun.” Cliopher was quite proud of himself for managing to get that all out.",
        "Cliopher felt too sozzled by surprise and magic and pure happiness to answer that. “I have no idea,” he said. “Fitzroy made me an island this morning. I cannot think about philosophy right now. I have only poetry in my heart.”",
        "“We were very good,” Cora repeated. “We didn’t throw Bertie overboard for not telling us that your beloved lord, your very dear friend, your Aurelius Magnus, was actually Fitzroy Angursell.”",
        "“You can do better than that, Kip,” Ghilly said. “He raised an island for you, the least you could do is, I don’t know—”\n“Hang a star?” Cliopher replied, and winked at her when she stopped, flustered. “I have a great deal to tell you all.”",

        "“You know that you were going to be in the Lays from your work in the world, right?”\n“I didn’t fall into Sky Ocean on purpose, Toucan.”\nToucan laughed; and Ghilly said, “As if you wouldn’t have if you’d known it was an option!”",
        "“You deserve each other,” Ghilly declared. “Because that sounds totally mad, I hope you know that?”\nHe grinned sheepishly at her. “I know.”",
        "“I’m certain—absolutely certain—that you are aware of the first, fundamental rule.”\n“Secure your boat. Yes. I am aware.”\n“And yet—”\nCliopher sighed.“And yet it is very clearly not here. I am also aware.”\n“I thought you might be,” Toucan said, grinning.”",
        "Fitzroy appeared dazed. “Have they adopted me?”\nCliopher took his arm, and turned him gently to continue along the canal. “Yes. I think you’ll find they have.”\n“What an amazing thing,” Fitzroy declared.",
        "“It’s apparently incapable of being removed. He hoped their last efforts—which I think involved putting it on a trading ship bound across the Wide Seas—would work. But it’s got some sort of magic, and it arrived back just after you returned to Solaara.”",
        "“You called him beloved,” Ludvic said quietly. “I heard you. You’ve loved him for a long time, Cliopher, but you did not call him that before you left.”",
        "“My people do not name the dead.”",
        "“Ludvic. Ludvic. My dear Ludvic. Masseo is going to be—I am so—” He laughed, and tried to smile, and then let go of Ludvic so he could cover his face.. “I am overcome.”",
        "“It was...perhaps it was wrong of me, but I...I always thought...in my culture, it is a good thing, to stand beside your...uncle.”",
        "“As if I were your father’s brother. As if we were truly...”\nHe didn’t finish, or perhaps couldn’t. But Cliopher heard the unspoken word, and so did Ludvic.\n“Yes,” he said, hardly any more loudly. “As if we were.”\n“All this time?”\n“Always.”",
        "“Kip, you’re ridiculous. I know you know this, but it has to be said.” Enya shook her head. “I do love you. Especially how ridiculous you are.”",
        "If you can be your own sort of fanoa, and ‘Auri and El’—cannot believe you have a nickname for Elonoa’a, that is impossible—anyway, if Elonoa’a and Aurelius Magnus can be their own sort of fanoa, then so can Galen and I.”",
        "“The other day, Kip and I went to go see what might lie under that new star, the one he hung in the sky, and since there wasn’t an island there I raised one for him...”\n“As you do,” Mardo said, his lips twitching.",
        "“It seems appropriate,” Ludvic said phlegmatically, “that you would manage to find, or be given, the shell of an extinct kind of mollusc to be representative of your love for each other.”",
        "“There is iconoclasm and then there is fucking the icon.”",
        "“There is another part of me that acknowledges (what have you people done to me) that it would probably do him a world of good to get done and also that you’d be the best person to do it, by which I mean him.”",
        "“Were you hoping I wouldn’t notice your arrival? The house called me, and this is not a negotiation for Cliopher alone.”",
        "“I am a velio, I know,” Fitzroy Angursell, the last Emperor of Astandalas, said to the Islander god, in the Islander language, “and yet I have studied your ways as best I can, for love of this man, my friend, my stalwart counsellor, my fanoa.”",
        "“You, little mage, little sunling, my dear little one, my tirului—” Cliopher shifted, and the god cackled. “Too much? Still, it’s all true. I would gladly adopt you as one of mine, fanoa of my husband’s grand-nephew, but you are well claimed.”",
        "“Oh, you are a sly one! You can be one of mine too, if you like, if no one has adopted you yet?”\n“I am part of the household of your kinsman,” Ludvic said sturdily.\n“So you are,” said Vou’a. “So you are.”",
        "Cliopher blinked. “I’ve never heard that story.”\n“You wouldn’t have,” Ludvic replied imperturbably. “Not for everyone’s ears, you know. But this is a matter for...” He hesitated, and then he smiled radiantly at them both. “For family.”",
        "“This is very good. Because I bet you—oh! You’re also the lord emperor, aren’t you?”\n“Alas, yes.”\n“No, no, that’s perfect, because you know about magic.”",
        "“No,” Ludvic said, vastly amused. “It’s not adventurous enough, is it? For either of you.”\n“All these years in which Kip valiantly pretended to be reasonable,” Fitzroy said, shaking his head, but he was grinning. “His true colours coming out at last.”",
        "“Yes, yes, Tanaea does indeed sound splendid.” Fitzroy shifted in his chair. “Even if she’s the right person, I don’t think I can handle returning yet, Ludvic.”\n“I know,” he said very simply.",
        "“Kip. Kip. Cliopher. I don’t have a poem in my mind right now.”\n“Don’t you?” Cliopher sang the notes of the melody Fitzroy had been humming when they went to create Navanoa.\n“You and your challenge-songs,” he grumbled.",
        "“Do I tell the lords of my court that I have spent the entirety of my time playing elaborate games? Do I say that I spent half my time making up dirty limericks about them?”\n“Did you, my lord?” Cliopher asked demurely.\nDemurely, but the challenge was there",
        "“There once was a wizard called Dorn, whom no one around here dared scorn, for her familiar companion was eerily reptilian—in fact, the only iguana in town!”",
        "“Damn you and your challenge-songs! What do you want of me? A dozen terrible limericks?”\n“As you wish, my lord.”\n“Do you see an iguana?”",
        "The Amboloyan Prince, Rufus—hmm—a hero of kicking up a fuss—pompous, dull, boring—we’re forever imploring: MUST his speeches be always superfluous?“",
        "It was not magic that was running through Fitzroy’s veins now, or only that common, ordinary, splendid magic of words—and the disciplined imagination of a great poet who had forced himself to close the door of his heart to protect his soul.",
        "Cliopher looked straight back at his fanoa with a silent well? Is this where you stop?\nFitzroy narrowed his eyes, and they held there, perfectly still. Intent. The challenge reverberating in the air between them: the tinder burning brightly.",
        "“It’s like that, is it?” Fitzroy said, in a very imperial-sounding voice, his magic slowly welling up into the room, limning everything with a sense of buzzing urgency, of the sudden possibility that everything might come alive and become something new.",
        "They held each other’s gazes: the great mage with his golden eyes full of magic, and Cliopher who was an ordinary man but who had looked full upon the face of the Sun and not been blinded.",
        "He held the spark Fitzroy had struck, and he held Fitzroy’s eyes.\nFitzroy was glittering and magnificent and every inch an emperor, a folk hero, a legend. His voice could have seduced the Moon or half the Nine Worlds into following him.",
        "“What, my lord Mdang? An island wasn’t enough for you?”",
        "Above them there was a jangle as if the wind had blown through the glass floats in the solarium. The same gust whipped through the room, scattering the limericks and sending a spray of sparks up out of the brazier.\nVery deliberately, Cliopher smiled.",
        "“Hear, children of the sun and of the wind, of the emperor Aurelius Magnus and his fanoa from across the sea: sing of their deeds of magic, their high-hearted courage, their love that crested the very sky, and weep for what glory once was in the world.”",
        "Cliopher tried, he really did, but when Fitzroy started to compare the dimensions of El’s prick to various kinds of bananas he could not help himself, and sniggered.",
        "“You disagree with the plantain? Trust me.”\n“To know what is most poetically appealing?”\n“That too, of course,” Fitzroy replied very serenely.\nCliopher set down his pen. “You cannot mean that the way that sounds.”",
        "“No, no, you mistake me!” Fitzroy’s voice was full of barely suppressed mirth. “I am not writing an erotic scene. This is going to be an epic, Kip. With all the details.”",
        "“I knew you were Fitzroy Angursell,” she added, greatly satisfied. “I knew it. And you so carefully didn’t deny it.”\n“It was all I could do not to fall upon your neck in gratitude,” Fitzroy said, with a light tone.",
        "“I was not involved in measuring anyone’s penis,” Cliopher exclaimed in exasperation, which was the point where Ludvic finally broke down into laughter.",
        "“Aya inDovo Delanis is here. With Fitzroy. They’re talking about techniques for writing sex scenes,” Cliopher said.\n“Oh, I can’t possibly miss that!” Ghilly said.",
        "“I’m not providing comparative measurements,” Cliopher said desperately. “You can get your own banana scale.”\n“I beg your pardon?” Toucan said. “I am fascinated by what could possibly have led to that response.”",
        "“Kip Mdang, did you acquire a house so the Red Company could live next door?”",
        "“Is there anything you want me to avoid saying?”\n“I trust you,” Ludvic said, very simply. “And him.”\n“Fitzroy,” Cliopher murmured, gently teasing.\nLudvic smiled. “Fitzroy.”",
        "“One of the greatest joys of my life was the expression on your face when I asked you if you wanted to be Duke of Ikiano and you refused with language that would make a sailor blush.”",
        "“Of course we can ask Jullanar’s help. She’s part of your family, your culture...our lives.”",
        "Fitzroy gave Cliopher a very brilliant look and carefully moved the flower to his right ear.\nCliopher felt a wash of some nameless emotion—some indescribable wonder, some intense humility, some astonishing gratitude, some sort of awe.",
        "“Don’t hurt yourself,” Toucan whispered. “He’ll still be there tomorrow.”",
        "“Dad said I shouldn’t call you Uncle Fitzroy but you are, aren’t you? More or less?”\nFitzroy, visibly choked up, nodded speechlessly.\nClio nodded with complete unconcern for upending someone’s world. “Great. I thought so.”",
        "If there were a party down in the green—and if he and Fitzroy were announcing they were fanoa—(and both of those things were true)—well. Perhaps it was a good thing that Féonie and Franzel and Conju had insisted he bring half court costume with him.",
        "“Uncle Kip, I have been thinking while you were gone,” he said again, as if it were a rehearsed speech, “and I would very much like to sit at your feet and learn to be tanà.”\n“I would be honoured to have you sit at my feet, Clio el Mdang White,” he said.",
        "Fitzroy looked him up and down, frankly appreciative, and let the door swing shut behind him as he came into the middle of the room. “Cliopher Lord Mdang, Viceroy of Zunidh and tana-tai of the Wide Seas Islanders.”\n“Your fanoa.”",
        "“I would like you to have this, as a token of my esteem, a promise of my affection, an affirmation of my readiness to follow your star wherever you wander with it, an acknowledgement of my willingness to raise an island for you whenever you need one.”",
        "“And...” Fitzroy took a deep breath. “And a statement of something I have never quite dared say in its full simplicity before, which is that I love you.”",
        "“That’s the Imperial Seal.”\n“It is,” said Fitzroy. “And you know very well that there is not another person in all the Nine Worlds and the lands beyond whom I would trust with it.”",
        "Cliopher had come to a kind of truce with her, but it was definitely easier for both of them to be polite after breakfast.",

        "The tanà was not the chief or the paramount chief, the saying went, but when the tanà spoke, the chiefs listened.\nKip wanted people to listen to him.",
        "Not afraid. He was thirteen and a half, he had studied with Buru Tovo for more than a year and Uncle Lazo for six months. Kip was not afraid.\nPerhaps a little—no, a trifle, that was the word—just a trifle worried.",
        "Buru Tovo had told him he had to go back to the city so he didn’t forget all the modern ways, but Kip had grown up with them, and he wanted the old ways.",
        "But he would make them see that the old ways were not just beautiful, but also—also alive. So much more alive than the dances at the festivals made them seem.",
        "Mama Ituri treated her people well, but she wasn’t safe. She was like Ani, the sea goddess, Uncle Lazo said: generous with her gifts and also with her temper.\nKip knew all about Ani’s temper.",
        "His mother told everyone Kip had been born stubborn, contrary as a fitful wind. His father used to laugh and say he wasn’t, he was just a boat that knew its own ke’ea, and if he just followed it faithfully, he’d get where he was going one day.",
        "He would be tanà, and he would be like Elonoa’a had been, and even the emperor on his golden throne, far far away from Gorjo City, would listen to him.",
        "What was Astandalas to them? Taxes, a government everyone complained about, schools that taught you only how to live in the city, not on the islands.",
        "Kip’s emperor, whoever he was when Kip was ready to go find him, probably wouldn’t need a navigator. He’d need Kip. And Kip would be the best tanà.",
        "It was hard to go back, that’s what the Lays taught.",
        "You did not hold the fire if you ran from its burn; but you could not hold the fire if you did not respect its flame.",
        "“You dove as far as you could into the sea, and could not get the last pearl you wanted. You climbed as high as you could, and broke what you hoped for on the way down. Is this where you stop?”\n“No,” he said “No. I’ll keep going.”",
        "“Lots of meanings you could take, from your stone breaking quite in half like that. Two halves that fit together can mean a lot of things.”"
