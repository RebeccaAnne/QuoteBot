No one to say his name. No one to touch him. No one to be his own, and no one else’s. No one for whom he could be himself.","Surely it was only petty treason.","“His Radiancy would not thank me to let you fall.”","A feeling of indescribable fondness welled up in him as he regarded his lord.","“I used to know who I was beyond my duties.”","He walked forward to meet his Radiancy, who was coming out of the water, looking (to Cliopher) like some story of Creation as the water streaming off his dark shoulders caught the light and the three men stood awaiting his coming.","The distant serene reserve that usually cloaked any hint of personality was gone, and in its place was an alert, amused, interested expression. \nHe looked, in short, like a man seized with an enthusiasm. \nHe was nearly unrecognizable.","“Your accent has grown noticeably stronger over the course of the day, Cliopher.”\nHe hastily put his thoughts back into courtly mode. “My apologies, my—” \n“No, do not mistake me. Pray speak as your heart moves you.”","“You are speaking of his Radiancy!” \n“I do not forget it!”","“Yet here you are,” his Radiancy said, smiling at him.\n“Yes, I am here,” said Cliopher, his heart singing.","“What is your name, what is your island, and what is your dance?”","“I will bring home the hearth-fire of a new life for the world.”","“You will not let me give you riches or titles or lands or any of the other honours it is usual for a lord to give his loyal servants, so instead I offer you this as your friend.”","“No one will ever pay me to copy out texts, I’m afraid, but every poet should see his work in book form at least once. It is good for the soul.”","“He called me his friend.”\n“Then you must continue to act in the office of friendship,” Cliopher said firmly.","“I have been wondering, my lord, whether it had occurred to you to retire.”","“I spent the night before my coronation praying for the Red Company to come take me away. They did not come: and so I became Emperor.”","“I am a human being, Conju! I have emotions and desires and frustrations and hopes and dreams and nightmares as much as anyone else. I have things I love and things I hate, things I prefer and things I abhor, and none of it matters.”","“You still do not know what I mean, do you? You kneel to me because you dared raise your voice to me. When have I ever given you cause to think I would punish you for speaking your mind?”","“Can you not understand that the walls between us are not of my making? That I do not want to be behind them? Can you not look at me and see not the Radiancy but the man?”","“It was so hard to keep fighting that I had nearly stopped. I had myself nearly convinced that it was merely the responsible thing to be so—so—so dull!”","“I never thought I would be the person who chose what is comfortable.”","“Will you not call Ser Rhodin and Elish out of the rain?”\nLudvic turned his head and raised his eyebrows at him. “They would not come. He gave them a direct order to stay there. They will obey.”","His Radiancy stood still, gazing down at him with that inscrutable expression, and then he did what Cliopher had never once seen him do: he knelt down. \n“Conju,” he said, quietly.","“Conju, if you insist on resigning I will not force you to stay. But I will be very sorry indeed to see you go—and sorrier than I can say to have made you feel unworthy and a failure.”","“That is not what I wished for.”","“I will give you a dream, and something to remember,” she said, “and half a hundred poems for you to write to me.” \n“I hear and obey,” he said. \n“You never did,” she said, with something like amusement. “Your tides are your own, Beloved.”","“My lord, may I speak very frankly?” \nHis Radiancy turned the lion gaze on him, holding his eyes for a long moment. Cliopher felt his power like a huge reservoir behind the dam of his will. \n“Yes.”","“You were the first one to look at me as if I were a human being instead of a god.” \n“That was treason, my lord,” Cliopher said quietly. \nThere was another silence. “I hate my life at times, Kip.”","“I have been fortunate beyond the lot of many men that not only can I, do I, admire and respect my lord and my master, but that I could, that I do, also love him.”","“My Lord, my ... Tor ... if you were my brother or my cousin I could not love you more.”","“I’m a career bureaucrat, my lord, not a—”\n“You,” said his Radiancy with precision, “are not dull. Stop acting like it.”","“Cliopher will not wear satin.”","“Whose livery is that?” \n“Yours, sir!”","“Your Radiancy stopped coughing and said: ‘Where am I?’ And I saluted and replied, ‘In the throne room of the Palace of Stars, Glorious One.’ ‘But this is not Ysthar,’ you said, ‘it is Zunidh. And the Empire is no more.”","“It is a matter of wild magic. Coincidence and serendipity are to be expected.”","And the centre of every gaze and every mind and every subtle line, that hundredth and last Emperor of Astandalas whom Cliopher loved.","There was a glint in his Radiancy’s eyes.\nCliopher was mortally certain he was the only one in all that room looking into them.","“Indeed, the strength of social pressure is one of the greatest forces in the world. The only force that is stronger is the individual will.”","“It is so much harder to stand up for a small, nearly frivolous thing. It is far easier, at least in imagination, to stand up for the great things.”","He spent a few silent moments preparing a new pen. Then he wrote, in precise lettering, 'Cliopher Lord Mdang defended the people of the Vangavaye-ve against their princess.' \nThere, he thought defiantly, let history read that.","“Kip,” his Radiancy said more gently. “Kip, look at me.” \n“Please, my lord,” he whispered, feeling the tears start to fall as he obeyed.","He felt himself to be entirely exposed, belly-up, defeated. He said, “They have never forgiven me for leaving.” \n“Have you ever forgiven yourself?” \nCliopher looked at him, met the lion eyes. Finally dropped his eyes in submission. “No.”","“If I die ... no, listen ... if I die, I have ... please ... last requests ...” \n“Whatever you want done, we will do,” Cliopher said recklessly, meaning every word.","But, another part of him said, the Lord Chancellor of Zunidh was able to be his Radiancy’s friend ... and that was worth all the work and headaches and stress ...","Ludvic looked up at his tone. “My lord, it is nothing for me to die in serving you.”\n“It is everything for me, Ludvic,” said his Radiancy in a low voice.","“I know some of the old traditions.” \nAnd that was as much as he could say that was true, he thought, here where he chose his work over his family over and over again.","“It comes of you being outside the true line. You were never supposed to become Emperor. You were never supposed to be seen.”","His Radiancy said very softly, “If ever I may effect the release of Fitzroy Angursell, madam, it shall be on the condition he write a song about you. You have said your piece: go now, and find what peace you can.”","“I do not ask for your political view. I wish to know what you, Kip Mdang, think.”\nCliopher met the lion eyes steadily. “My lord, I have devoted my life to your service.” \n“And?”\n“And I think that of all people, Fitzroy Angursell should be free.”","“The world knows your devotion, Lord Mdang.”","“To hell with the Viceroyship!”","“My lord, you cannot button it away.” \n“I nearly think you said I cannot.”","“You overreach yourself, sir. You are dismissed,” his Radiancy said icily, and that, he supposed, was that.","“There is no way,” Ludvic burst out, “that his Radiancy would consider that treasonous from you. He loves you as a brother.” \n“He sent me away,” Cliopher whispered.","“Are you suggesting I go counter to a direct order?” \nThey looked at each other intently, he and Ludvic and Conju, the air heavy with anxiety and fear. Conju backed down; but Ludvic said, in his usual phlegmatic way, “How deeply do you love him?”","And that even if Cliopher was not Domina Black, did not walk through the world like a thunderstrike, nevertheless he could do his best, and that if that meant he was to be executed for his love, then he would do what he could beforehand.","If he was going to be executed for the treason of treating his Radiancy as a person he might as well go all the way with it. \nKnocked again, and this time into the ensuing silence he said: “Tor.”","His Radiancy stood frowning down at him, his power high and menacing. Cliopher did not try to match his stare, but thought of himself as a stone being swamped by the sea. If the sea truly wished to unseat him, he knew he would have no recourse.","But the wave ebbed. Ebbed from drowning Cliopher; and ebbed, he saw, from drowning that inner man whose name he did not know, save that it was almost certainly not Tor. But he had no other name to offer him.","“Tor,” he said again, very softly, “please.” \nIf he had heaved a stone through a window he could not have seen a shattering as complete as what he saw breaking in his Radiancy’s eyes.","He draped him with it and then he sat down on the edge of the desk and with the cloth between them held the Last Emperor of Astandalas as he cried.","“I felt like a ghost. No one could touch me, and I could touch no one. I cast no shadow, and shadows did not land on me. My slightest whim was obeyed, but any real desires I had were forbidden by the entire edifice of Schooled magic and Imperial policy.”","“Everyone was terrified of me. Oh, I should clarify: not me. It was never me that anyone looked at, that anyone saw, that anyone thought about. It was always the Emperor.”","“I hated everything about being Emperor. Everything. I hated how other people treated me, I hated how I was expected to treat other people, I hated all the taboos, I hated the total lack of privacy, I hated the magic that was turning me inside out.”","“Will you speak so to me? Will you speak so for me? Will you speak so about me?”","Ludvic rubbed his left hand down the long golden scars on his arm. “It seemed right to me that I should die from his touch. For so long I have felt unworthy of living when they did not.”","“At the end, when the priests came, I thought only that you were the Lord Chancellor, that you needed to know. Then I saw your face. I had not known you felt that way.”","“You have a loving family big enough to include Conju, and Rhodin, and himself. And me. I am grateful. That is all.”","Ludvic looked down, as if ashamed, though to Cliopher they were banners of love to be waved proudly. No one else had ever touched the Last Emperor after he became Emperor but for the Moon. No one else had ever been touched by him.","“Tell him that the next time I see him I will ask him for his name.”","“His Radiancy has instructed that you may have access to his person whenever you request it.”","“My name is Ludvic Omo. My island is Woodlark in the Azilint. We do not have your dances, but the head of my carving is Odongai.”","“Lord Artorin, my boy there wants me to tell him he can claim the fire. He’s trying not to look like he already has.”","Something moved in him and prompted him to say, slowly, the traditional words. “It’s a long story of the sea to tell it.” \nAfter a moment Buru Tovo replied with the equally traditional words. “We sit by the fire ready to hear it.”","“And across the Wide Seas, they said, a wall of storms.”","“I should have gone. As soon as I saw the ship go I knew I should have gone ... I ...” He stopped, breath catching again. “I didn’t go. I let her go without me. I did not stand up for what I knew was the right decision.”","“She sat there under an umbrella at the edge of the clearing where we worked and shouted vague instructions at me.” \n“You always respond so well to that,” his Radiancy murmured. \nCliopher smiled. “Yes, my lord.”","Buru Tovo spoke sternly. “Her body went to the waves and her spirit to the call of her ancestors, guiding a fire-tender across the Wide Seas. She was Nga. She died valiantly. You may let her go from your hands.”","They all looked at him. After a bit, his Radiancy said, “You’re not a wizard. You can’t tell by magic ... how did you find out where you were? For I perceive that you are now here, rather than a wild hermit on a remote isolated island.” \n“I danced.”","“It is the crescent moon four days from now,” he said. “You will dance Aōteketētana then before your community here.” \n“You will dance it in the throne room,” said his Radiancy, equally firmly, and then he smiled. “At the feet of the Sun.”","“Lord Lior, I would respect you more if you came right out and called me a savage.”","“I lit the first fire in the Palace after the Fall of Astandalas—and I tell you, sir, I have not let it go out since.”","“From the Sun-on-Earth have I learned my destination, and with the stars of my principles to guide me, I know the way.”","“I do not care what anyone thinks of my work except for the Sun-on-Earth and my own heart’s conscience.”","Sixteen children had she borne, and fifty-nine grandchildren in their turn, and the seed of the gardens both real and metaphorical of his grandfather were spread far and wide around the Ring and even so far as here in Solaara.","He had not wanted a parade in the Vangavaye-ve. He had not wanted cheering throngs to follow him down the street. He had not even wanted things to change. \nBut he would have liked someone to say ‘congratulations’.","Cliopher thought again of his Radiancy, who never had anyone to hold him against his fears. Missed him suddenly, fearfully, frighteningly.","“Close your eyes, Kip, and trust me.” \nCliopher had always responded well to direct orders from those he greatly respected. He closed his eyes.","“Princess Oriana,” he said finally. “I think you had better inform his Radiancy of your opinion of me.”","“That was one of the most elegant and subtle displays of power it has ever been my privilege to witness, and I must thank you for the pleasure of the experience.”","“His Radiancy turned Earl Baljan into a table?”\n“Yes. I didn’t know anyone could do that, outside of stories.”\nCliopher was absurdly pleased by the notion that a wizard from a book of fables would turn someone into a table on his behalf.","“Did you have any problems, Rhodin? Toucan?” \n“Hillen tried to bribe us,” Rhodin said. “Poorly.” \n“Five cases of Amboloyan wine were not sufficient?” \n“As it happens, I prefer my head.”","“I do love a good parade.” \n“My lord, I will be delighted to arrange one for you on any occasion you please.” \n“Except this one?” His Radiancy laughed again.","“I have entered in the Gates of the Sea. I see the harbour with the eyes of my body as well as the eyes of my heart.”","“You have always been one of the most traditional people to come here.”","“I think he would like it,” Cliopher said firmly, “but even if I am wrong, I would prefer to have the place there to be rejected than not to offer it.” \nRhodin breathed in sharply. “You do know him better than anyone else.”","“His Radiancy would give you the house if you asked him.” \n“His Radiancy would probably give me an island if I asked him, but that doesn’t mean I’m going to.”","Rhodin said, “I do not believe that anyone would ever think for a moment that you feel anything but the greatest love and respect for his Radiancy.”","Rhodin caught his eye and said meaningfully, “Kip is his Radiancy’s closest friend.”","“There’s no blasphemy in pointing out the truth. It is blindingly obvious. When you want to share some news, it is to him you look—and when he wishes to talk, it is with you.”","“There is no one in this world who can say I have lied to them, Aunt Hilda, and you are not the exception.”","“We expect that only Kip, and Kip alone, knows what sacrifices he has made, and to what end. We will say only that we have never had any reason to doubt his loyalty, his service, his love, his devotion to his family, or his staunch upholding of the law.”","“I chose the latter course, and as a result have had the great pleasure and even greater good fortune of witnessing the development and coming to maturity of perhaps the finest statesman in recorded history.”","“I have accomplished many things as Lord of Zunidh, but it is my belief that when history judges me against the greater sweep of time, my greatest achievement will be said to be appointing Cliopher Mdang to a position of authority.”","“Peace, I said, expecting none. Two weeks later Kip requested an audience and handed me the draft of an agreement between the warring parties. That agreement became the foundation for the Littleridge Treaty, and those wars have never recurred.”","“Do not fret that he has left you behind, for he never has. I knew your names long before I ever stepped foot in the Vangavaye-ve; and I know the philosophies of your Lays as well as any velio might.”","This day was surely a gift of the Son of Laughter.","Nothing was disproportionate, nothing distorted, nothing missing. Every smallest element of the design was correct, declaring his identity as a Mdang of Tahivoa in Gorjo City, whose island was Loaloa, whose dances were Aōteketētana.","He did spare a thought for how likely it was that she would work to unseat him, perhaps try to have him disgraced or even assassinated. \nRhodin and Ludvic would keep him safe, he thought.","“Your great-uncle said these were the necklaces,” Féonie said. “The efani, the efevoa, and the efetana.”","But in that superlative version of his customary finery, he realized that what he looked like was the tanà, the Tender of the Fire, the advisor to chiefs and paramount chiefs—and emperors.","“I sing the Wide Seas!”","Cliopher said, “You don’t have to give me the okana, Paramount Chief, but you must know that once you have begun you must not allow the ember to go out before you have lit a new fire.” \nJiano turned to the hall. “Thus speaks the tanà!”","“Lord of Rising Stars, I offer you in my hands the Vangavaye-ve.” \n“Cliopher Mdang, what is the Vangavaye-ve?” \n“Lord of Rising Stars, the Vangavaye-ve is the home of my heart, the land of my birth, the anchorage of my soul.”","“Cliopher Mdang, offer us your hands.” \nCliopher was far from fear, far from the taboos. His gaze was held in golden brilliance. He reached forward—up—and around his trembling hands closed the beautiful long fingers of his beloved lord. ","He heard the words. They were imprinted, he was sure, on his heart. Nothing had ever been so real as the words—except for the hands clasping his.","He felt himself in his Radiancy's regard, the one solid rock in a tumultuous sea of responsibilities. The rock: vivid, strong, certain, sure.\nBeloved came the assurance.","Good humour, running as a burbling current always through their interactions, the small interactions of friendship that took loyalty of vassal to lord and lord to vassal to some height beyond them as song was beyond speech.","“I will not fail you.”","“Witness this, you people of the Vangavaye-ve. Cliopher Mdang of Tahivoa, whose island is Loaloa, whose dances are Aōteketētana, whose ancestral ship is the Ouvaye-ve, is our chosen Viceroy.”","“I, Cliopher Mdang of the Vangavaye-ve, do swear upon my soul and my heart and my life that I will keep this world of yours safe while you are absent and return it hale to you when you are come home.”","Cliopher knelt where he was, the tears streaming down his face, his hands in his Radiancy’s, the ember flaring softly in the shell cupped between them.","Islander culture did not think it shameful to show strong emotions. It was, in fact, considered the mark of a strong soul, one to be admired, when beauty or love or grief could call forth such powerful response.","“There is a story I have heard of three brothers, the sons of Vonou’a. One left to see what he could see on the other side of the horizon. One left to find his heart’s desire. And one left to sit at the feet of the Sun.”","“I am Cliopher Mdang of Tahivoa. My island is Loaloa. My dances are Aōteketētana.”","“I am Mdang. I hold the fire: I do not run from its burn.”","“Did you get married? It looked like you got married.”","Cliopher heard the plinking cascades of his Radiancy’s harp, and felt his heart overflowing again with gratitude, that his family could make his Radiancy so happy, that he was so happy, that his Radiancy was happy, that his family was happy.","“I feel it is a wasted day if I have not managed to discompose Kip at least once.”","“Come, my friends, we shall announce an amnesty on Fitzroy Angursell’s music tonight, and let us make merry in honour of the great statesman with the music of the great outlaw. There is something delicious about the whole idea.”","“You clasped shoulders, embraced, hugged, kissed, touched foreheads, bowed over your hands—I have not—Kip, I haven’t touched anyone! I don’t know how.” \n“Here, my lord,” he said, getting up and opening his arms slightly. “I will show you.”","‘They mean the common and ordinary good of duty honourably fulfilled, of love occasionally accompanied by quarrels, of friendships that will not fail, of a home filled with laughter and music and family.’","His Radiancy regarded him solemnly for a moment, then walked forward to embrace him. “I know you will keep Zunidh safe and sound for me,” his Radiancy said, leaning forward until his forehead touched Cliopher’s in the Islander greeting.","He looked back at Cliopher. “No final words, Kip?” \nCliopher felt a great rush of endearment welling up. “Have fun.” \nAnd his Radiancy laughed as he set his face to the sun and stepped alone across the threshold of his Palace for the first time.","And Cliopher with a singing heart began to explain the principles of the Great Plan, which he had developed from those fundamental teachings of the proper relations between people and communities he had long ago been taught from the Lays."],"atfots":["#atfotsquotes#\n\nAt the Feet of the Sun"],"atfotsquotes":["There were too many days like today, where it was only now, in the quiet midnight, that he managed to get out-of-doors at all.","Like the tui trees, blooming every year regardless of who came or did not come, Cliopher was waiting for someone.\nHis lord and friend, the Last Emperor and Lord of Zunidh whose Viceroy he was, was away. Travelling.","“In the beginning Turtle dove down into the muck at the bottom of the sea and brought up mud to be made into land, and as a reward the Creator put him up in the sky as a constellation. It’s always a good idea to be polite to turtles, the old men say.”","Cliopher was a Mdang, and he Held the Fire. He could hold this fire he had been given to hold, tend this hearth-fire at the heart of the world, and when his lord, his emperor, his Aurelius Magnus, came home, Cliopher would be waiting for him.","He wanted home. And he wanted people there who were not there, who could not be there, and he did not know what to do.","“No, sir: you don’t understand. You were the man from the proverb—the person I’d always been told not to imitate—the man who came looking for the sea—and then I learned that you found it.”","“According to all our readings, in the bones and the smoke and the ink on water, in the hands of the casters and the dreams of the dream-walkers and the visions of the seers, the comet has come for you.”","“I thank you for the message, although I do not know how I can be of such interest to the gods.”\nAll the stories said it was a very dangerous thing, to be of such interest to the gods.","Even absent, he was a solid place to stand, and Cliopher wanted nothing more than to follow the star-path his Radiancy had set off upon.","The sound of Islander rolled through the silent room like thunder, like the breakers on a reef.","“The Wind That Rises At Dawn fills my sails. The Wake of the Ancestors’ Ships have I seen. The star-paths of Sky Ocean are singing to me.”","There was a story in the Lays about an irreparable loss: a pattern for resignation, dignified acceptance, strength despite adversity. Cliopher had always hated it.","He wished his Radiancy were there: to laugh with him about Prince Rufus and Princess Anastasiya, to come up with something for Melissa, to—\nTo talk to.\nAs if they were real people, with whole hearts and private lives and privacy.","Of course his Radiancy was actually the notorious outlaw and trickster poet Fitzroy Angursell.\nOf course he was.","He did not miss things like this. He didn’t.\n(—He had.)","His Radiancy had trusted Cliopher to run the world in his absence, but he hadn’t trusted him with that.","Why hadn’t his Radiancy told him?\n(Why hadn’t Cliopher guessed?)","Ludvic sighed. “I miss him,” he said simply. “It’s not the same with him gone.”","“What do you mean?—When did you find out?”\nLudvic gave him one of the familiar blank-faced, laughing-eyed looks. “Oh, I’ve known since the beginning.”","Did he sound jealous? He didn’t mean to. Ludvic could have—did have—his own close relationship with the lord he had served so long as well. With the man whose friend he was. They could both be friends.","‘So, Fitzroy, do you think you’ve served your full sentence yet?’","“That was when I knew. And I swore then I would always stand behind him, because I have never admired anyone so much as that moment. He had no choice to become emperor, you know. But he could have said no then, and he didn’t. He didn’t.”","Cliopher closed his eyes. “I would have helped him, if he’d told me.”\n“You did help him,” Ludvic replied gently.","So his lord was not what he’d thought—and so? He did not need to chase that viau, seek that sea, any longer. \nThere were other seas to seek, to find, to sail. He could be content with them.\n(All of this was a lie.)","He might not be able to be the Last Emperor of Astandalas’ greatest friend—Fitzroy Angursell had his own great friends of the Red Company—but Cliopher had done his best in his Radiancy’s service. Done well in that service.","His thoughts wandered once more to his Radiancy—to Fitzroy Angursell—and his poetry. Then he looked at the painter again, her warm smile, her intense eyes, the deliberate placement of her hand on his thigh, and he felt an answering stir.","“Oh, you know—the passage connecting your rooms to his Radiancy’s.”\n“What passage? Where?”\nRhodin snickered. “Oh, don’t be coy! How else would you attend your secret assignations?”","My friend—the Impostor, you know, my correspondent?”","“I am trying,” Cliopher said, his voice coming soft. “I am trying so hard, Rhodin.”","He had wanted to sail the Wide Seas with his Radiancy beside him, as Elonoa’a had sailed with Aurelius Magnus; he had wanted to find a new island, a new star, the currents that would open up the gates between worlds.","“Aya and Jiano told us to ... make wishes, to the bonfire. Did you ask for yourself?”\n“No,” he said plainly, if quietly.\nRhodin nodded, entirely unsurprised, and set his hand on the door. Before he opened it, he said: “You’re allowed to.”","His Radiancy, Fitzroy Angursell, could come and go as he pleased, and if it did not please him to come, well, Cliopher had no claim on him beyond the service he had already offered, and the honours he had already received in return.","“We—those of us who are seekers after the wisdom of the Merrions—use dinosaur, or sometimes you will hear saurian, when we are speaking of the hyperintelligent telepathic cousins of the brute thunder lizards.”","What secrets did he yet hold in his heart that he himself had yet to uncover?","“And if it is the case that he has received them, but for one reason or another has been unable to reply ... I do not want him to think we have forgotten him.”","He did not need to be embarrassed for ... loving people, surely.\nAnd it was no secret that he was devoted to his Radiancy.","“Cliopher ... please.” It was extremely rare for any of his Islander friends to call him Cliopher. He looked sharply at Toucan. “Cliopher. We love you as you are. Let yourself be yourself.”","The rest of us say that so long as there is a tanà to light the fire, our culture will never fail. The rest of the lore-keepers keep the old ways for us all, but the tanà shows us what it means to be an Islander.”","Tanaea-te imalo! Moa’a-ki imalo! Kifa’ana imai? I bring a fire for your hearth! I bring news of the Wide Seas! Have you any problems for me?","For the first time he wanted to go and not come back.\nBut of course he could not do that; not yet. His Radiancy had given him these reins of government to hold, and Cliopher knew his duty.","One who holds the fire went as Elonoa’a went\nTo sit at the counsels of the emperors and speak for the people.","His voice took on the familiar teasing tone, and Cliopher could—could not handle it.\n“Bertie,” he interrupted softly, “please. I ... I can’t joke about him. Not ...”","Cliopher was drowning in an ocean of light.\nHe was far below the surface, in water that was not water, in light that was not light, in a sea that was not anything he had ever known.\nThere were voices singing.\nThe song was the song of the Lays.","He was dying and if he did not now sing his name he would be lost, fall to the darkness below the luminous waters, fall into the oblivion where the Old Woman Who Lives in the Deeps would ingather him to her silent company.","The door opened. Cliopher stood up politely, courteously, summoning his best court-impervious expression.\nKip Mdang walked in.","“The man known as Fitzroy Angursell is in an oubliette in the Palace: what I have learned, what I know, is that he can still be freed.”","His heart was hammering in his throat, with memory and desire and that hope for something he had never been able to say.","“I,” Rhodin said proudly, “was informed by your younger self that I was the only aristocrat he’d ever encountered who was of any use whatsoever.”","“Don’t follow Protocol 143.”","His Radiancy was Fitzroy Angursell. He was everything Cliopher had always loved most from the wider empire, the great emperor-mage, the even greater revolutionary poet.\nHis friend.\n(That was another lie. There was another word.)","Where had that poetry gone? Cliopher did not write like this any longer, did he? He did not search for such splendid metaphors. He had lifted the form of the bureaucratic report to an art; but at what cost?","You took him there and yet he is not certain of you?\nHe must ask you to take his words as the words of a friend?\nHe must ask you to grant him that—\nI am angry again, not at what you gave up but what you have not yet claimed.","How could you let him sail off alone on his adventure? Why is he travelling without you? If he was stolen away by the Sun and the Moon, you know what to do.","He was the tanà. He Held the Fire. He did not run from its burn.\nHe felt singed.","Cliopher had never been either fully of the court or fully at home. Too much one, too much the other, never enough of either to satisfy anyone.\nNo, that was unfair. It had satisfied his Radiancy.","Cliopher remembered when it had been fun.\nChallenging, at any rate.\nHe did not miss those days.\nHe missed his Radiancy.","I hope, I think, I dare to imagine you will not think less of me for saying it is harder than I thought to be once more in the world.","Cliopher ...\nI dare to write to you as a friend. Please ... please accept it as if we sat together on the sandbar at Navikiani, far out in the lagoon, far from any ears, any guards, any need to guard ourselves.","You gave me that gift back, too, didn’t you? That holiday on Lesuia where I was able to remember myself.\nWe never sat beside a fire together there, did we? Not just the two of us. We should have.","—Your servant, in a manner of speaking.","“Do not be afraid,” the Mother of the Mountains said. “You are surrounded by magic, by the love and esteem Lord Artorin bears for you, by all the protections his love and esteem have woven around you.”","“I can see nothing but darkness ... except that there is one tiny white thing ... a shell, I think ... very far in the distance.”","The Mother of the Mountains looked up at him, her eyes full of magic, of wonder, of mystery. “And for the possibility of a tiny white shell,” she said, “you would face the certainty of darkness?”","“It is a common and ordinary good.”\n“And for those,” the Mother of the Mountains said, “you have shown over and over again you would face any darkness and doubt.”\n“I would,” he said, for he always had.","He could go home. But he didn’t want to.\nHe wanted that shell on the other side of the darkness.","“After what happened at Woodlark ... I was already almost-outcast. People knew why I’d done it, made those orders. They could ... respect that someone had to. But they could not like me for it.”","The two of them sat there, two hinterland tribesmen who had learned what they had to teach until the two of them could play their games better than any of them, and now sat there opposite each other, the Viceroy and the Commander in Chief of Zunidh.","“You should go find your cousin. Go find him. Go find yourself.”","“There are other people to hold your fire here,” Ludvic said, very seriously. “It will not go out because you have left it. It will stay lit because you have taught other people to tend it. Let them.”","“The Mother of the Mountains said all she could see was darkness ahead of me.”\nLudvic raised his eyebrows at him, almost just as his Radiancy did. “All?”\nCliopher closed his eyes. “Darkness, and monsters, and a small, ordinary, common white shell.”","His Radiancy. Fitzroy Angursell. A man who had resigned himself to being considered only a god, and never again known properly and fully for himself.","“She gave me the beads. My father carved them, when he was still an apprentice to his father, before ... My mother was the one to magic them. A gift for me, from—from both of them. And then she told me his name.”","Masseo Ironhand, who shod the horses of the wind; who had made locks that could hold a shadow hostage; who had forged swords out of starlight.\nMaybe Masseo Umrit was worthy of having Ludvic for a son. Maybe. Cliopher would have to find out.","“What if we meet up with danger?” Rhodin asked. “Robbers, for instance.”\nCliopher eyed the wicked steel implements laid out on the table with distaste. “Then I will talk us out of it, and if I cannot, then you will fight,” he said.","Here, though, where everything was new and uncertain, Cliopher was struck anew both by Rhodin’s great competence and his deep strangeness.","“It will be better when you know for certain,” Rhodin said quietly.\nCliopher swallowed. Sometimes he forgot how excellent a friend Rhodin was, really.","The boy—his nephew, in all but the strictest definition—oh this was Basil’s son, it was!—opened his mouth and breathed the traditional words of greeting. “Tē ke’e’vina-tē zēnava parahë’ala!”","“Basil,” Cliopher said, no longer easily, all the years of silence standing enormous in his throat. “Basil.”\n“Kip,” said Basil, equally hoarsely. “Kip.”","Kip—I—I hoped that people at home were alive, I hoped that they’d survived the Fall, I thought they must have ... but I didn’t ... I couldn’t see how I could go home if you weren’t there.”","He watched Clio splashing with his oars, scuttling across the calm, still water, the foreign trees around him, the very earth a different colour, and could only think that being a Wide Seas Islander also had to include this.","And if he were humming Aurora as he worked—\nWell. At least he had started to recognize when he did so.\nAnd it wasn’t as if it weren’t the greatest work to so far come from the pen of the poet laureate of Zunidh, his dear friend.","He could almost hear his Radiancy’s voice, laughter barely suppressed: “Hard at work, Lord Mdang?”\n“Always, my lord,” he replied out loud, and then chuckled quietly at himself for his fancies.","“Cat got your tongue, Lord Mdang?” his Radiancy said, his voice as serene as it had ever been, but Cliopher was looking into his eyes and he could see the hesitation there, the all-too-human doubt, the hope—","“My lord. My—Tor.” And then, as he came around the desk, and he did not know what to do besides that he could not, he must not, fall into that habitual formal prostration, his tongue ran away from him and he said, “Fitzroy Angursell.”","“Fitzroy Angursell,” he said, the name like Basil’s ginger wine in his mouth. He let his right hand come up and rest upon his Radiancy’s hand, still holding onto his elbow, just as if he were an ordinary man, his friend.","He gazed at his Radiancy, his friend, Fitzroy Angursell, his fanoa (oh, if only) and did not know what to say.","“I’m fine,” he said. “Truly.”\nThere was nothing serene in his Radiancy’s eyes, face, voice. “Cliopher. Kip. You were caught in a landslide.”\n“Pikabe lost his arm.”\n“Pikabe isn’t here,” his Radiancy said, his eyes nearly liquid gold. “Nor is he you.”","His Radiancy: the sun of his life, he had told Buru Tovo. He was burning more brightly before him than he ever had in all the pomp and majesty of his role as Sun-on-Earth.","“Kip,” said his Radiancy, and made a vague beckoning gesture.\nCliopher obeyed out of impossibly long habit, impossibly deep regard.","“I’m sorry I didn’t ...”\n“You did everything,” his Radiancy replied immediately, and then there was a pause while they both failed to meet the other’s eye.","“We’re basically in-laws at this point, aren’t we?”\nHis Radiancy held terrifically still.\n“I’m not certain Kip’s ready to say that,” his Radiancy said, but his hand was still on Cliopher’s shoulder, and Cliopher could feel how his fingers were trembling.","She looked just as he had always imagined Ani would look, if the sea-goddess took human form. Copper-skinned, full-figured, even fat—‘generous as the whole width and depth of the Wide Seas,’ whispered a line from an old, old song.","“Oh my dear friend!” Sardeet Avramapul cried, bouncing out of her seat and granting Rhodin a smile beyond metaphor. “Can it be? My dear friend! My correspondent! My penpal! My heart!”\nHis Radiancy, beside Cliopher, actually murmured, “Astonishing.”","Sardeet laughed. Cliopher was slightly surprised that flowers did not start blooming at the sound.","He kept his knee pressed against Cliopher’s, who wished fruitlessly and furiously that he had been able to offer any such comfort in the past.","Cliopher admired her beauty, but he could not stop himself from thinking of the light in his Radiancy’s eyes when Cliopher had finally called him by his name.","“Now, now, Kip, this is serious. I gave him the room next to yours, but do I need to tell him that there was a problem and you need to share?”\nThat was—that was—“That’s not true.”","His Radiancy should not have looked at him like that, with his Fitzroy Angursell smile and the depth of meaning that their long acquaintanceship had given them. Cliopher’s face was tight and hot and he gripped his oboe, unable to muster the proper decorum.","Cliopher could not let himself name, let alone articulate, what he was feeling, for he would go up in flames as the driest tinder under a spark from two striking rocks.","You’re allowed to stop, the Mother of the Mountains had told him. But Cliopher had never been allowed to stop, never allowed himself to stop, never dared to stop.","His Radiancy, Fitzroy Angursell, had a wicked look in his eyes. A challenging look; a dare.\nIt was like that, was it?","The book of censored poetry was the only thing he’d ever stolen from the Palace.\nWell. Except for the government, of course.","There was the gleam in his Radiancy’s eyes—still a touch wicked, but more appreciative, almost hilarious—and there were the strange harmonies of oboe and harp, and there was song after song after song.","There had been a single note in there, the first time Cliopher had received anything like a personal note from his Radiancy.\n‘Ah, you found it! Well done. Always going above and beyond.’","“You're Uncle Kip’s—” Cliopher coughed, and Clio gave him a strange look, then continued, “fanoa.”\nHe just said it.\nCliopher was simply speechless. Clio had just said it, as if it were easy, as if it were normal, as if it were a common and ordinary thing.","“You are in the company of Fitzroy Angursell. What’s the worst that could happen?”","“The other meaning is ... archaic.”\n“I like archaic words,” his Radiancy murmured, stopping in the very middle of the stream.\n“So do I,” Cliopher admitted.","He made to let go of his Radiancy’s hand, but his Radiancy was having none of it.\nHis Radiancy, Fitzroy Angursell, was a great mage and had been on many strange adventures. If he wanted to keep holding hands ...\nCliopher held hands.","He stared up at the tall palm. Was he thirsty enough to climb it?\nAfter a long, reluctant moment he decided that even if he wasn’t, his Radiancy would be.","No one—not even Fitzroy Angursell—had ever wanted to write a song about his postal system reforms.","The fanoa who had been Cliopher’s image and dream and ideal of friendship his entire life long.\nThey had been making love in the surf.\nThey were not—\nThat was not what fanoa meant. It couldn’t be. It couldn’t be.","He felt sick with loss, as if his heart had been pierced and all his wistful dreams had gushed out of it, disappearing into the sand below their feet.","Cliopher had a bare moment of astonishment at realizing that his Radiancy—Fitzroy—was speaking Islander.\nA little haltingly, with hesitation, but ... Islander. Islander!","People understood the idea that a lover might follow his beloved anywhere. It had always been a strange and difficult idea that one might love a friend that deeply.","Cliopher said, very precisely, “You are known as the greatest of friends.” Fanoa, fanoa, fanoa. The word lingered in his mouth, the taste of it so beautiful on his tongue. He took a breath. “I shall be glad to take home the truth of your relationship.”","The ancient tanà said, “You say that very confidently. You do not think it will be hard to change something that has stood for so many centuries?”\nCliopher could not resist a glance at his Radiancy. They simultaneously burst out laughing.","“It’s been a great consolation and encouragement to me on my recent travels. The knowledge that you could spend so long and so much of your life at court, in the Service, and yet when the challenges came you can step up to them with the whole of yourself.”","“As you started to claim your culture more publicly, as we became closer friends, I conceived the idea that I wanted to ... surprise you. Make it a gift.”\nCliopher stopped and regarded him, speechless.\n“I did surprise you,” Fitzroy said smugly.","“Come, will you sing with me if I play? I’ve wanted–”\nHe stopped, and smiled crookedly without finishing the thought.\nThere had been so many years when they could have been such better friends.\n“So have I,” he said, and left everything else unsaid.","“You’ve been together long?” Aurelius asked.\nFitzroy’s hand gripped Cliopher’s shoulder tightly for a moment. “Yes,” Fitzroy said, his voice warm, clear, strong as the brilliant waters of Sky Ocean. “Half our lives.”","“He danced the fire in the throne room of the Palace of Stars,” Fitzroy said, too proudly for Cliopher to parse. “It was one of the three most magnificent things I have ever seen.”","“They have done so much already for Auri ... They must be tired ...”\n‘Resentful’ hovered in the air between them, unspoken.\n“They came for their own reasons,” Cliopher said. “They stay for love.”","“Jullanar said it was important before you do laundry. Don’t you check your pockets first?”\n“I’ve never done my own laundry.”\n“What? Jullanar said—never mind!”","“I have never been to the House of Sun. I am Cliopher Mdang of Tahivoa, tanà of Zunidh and Hands of the Emperor, and I will go there and bring you the flame you need.”","“I talked to the Mother of the Mountains. She told me that a great mage’s attention tangles magic around one. That your attention and ... regard ... had drawn magic around me.”\n“My love,” Fitzroy said, very quietly.","“I don’t want to leave you,” Cliopher said helplessly, a truth he could not keep silent.\nFitzroy’s voice came out in a thin, hard tone, very unlike him. “I don’t want you to go.”","“I hate seeing people go,” Fitzroy said, and his voice was flat, dispirited, defeated. “Always ... always. I had to give the orders, and they go, and so often they do not come back ...”\n“I will come back.”\n“You cannot promise me that.”\n“I always have.”","“The Mother of the Mountains told me there was darkness before me, in the depths, in the heights, if I did not turn back.”\nFitzroy was silent for a long time.\n“Why didn’t you turn back, Kip?”\n“She said she saw a shell on the other side,” he whispered.","“What a song I shall write of this,” Fitzroy added, in a low voice, when Cliopher looked down once more at the pot in his hands. “Of you.”","“East first,” he murmured, his breath warm and sweet on Cliopher’s face. “Then west and home. Come home to me, Kip. Come home.”","Once, so silently he did not know if he were awake or dreaming, a pure white fin whale surfaced beside him. She was enormous: it seemed to take forever as the long forehead crested the water until an eye, dark and wise and curious, looked at him.","He followed the Ancestors, yes, but—\nBut he would not be himself if he did not help the needy before him, if he could do anything about it. It did not matter if it made the voyage longer, harder, more perilous—","“The sea turtles are lore-keepers! Honour them!”","He did not need to land. Theoretically he could keep sailing, past this island, into the silent reaches of Sky Ocean.\nSailing past was not how the story went.\nIt did not, in fact, make a good story.","He was Cliopher Mdang of Tahivoa, tanà of the world, and he had a commission from his emperor to fulfill.","No doubt if he were a proper hero on a quest, he would have somehow or other made friends with a finch or a mouse or a whole family of uncannily wise birds who would be delighted to do the sorting for him.\nFitzroy would have made such a friend.","He started sorting the kernels by colour.\nThis was, he might have admitted to Fitzroy, something he actually enjoyed.","He was entirely in her power. She had only to speak the word, and he would be one of those white-masked black boobies, muttering over their follies on the islets that followed after the sea-witch’s home. One word, and he would be undone, lost forever.","“Such a handsome man,” she murmured, her hand rather lower than Cliopher liked, from a sea-witch so early in the morning.","“Always liked you, Kip Mdang,” Vou’a repeated. “A fool, mind you, but what’s life without a little folly? You’ll catch your viau one day, if you keep chasing.”","He had always thought there was more down there, in his heart, where he had never gone.","(And what was the Protocol for blindly plumbing the depths of a cave that was somehow also his heart, on an island far into Sky Ocean?)","He crawled, wriggled, abased himself in the darkness.\nThere was, he told himself through gritted teeth, ashamed of his weakness, a shell on the other side. A common, ordinary good: his.","Was this really the store of secrets he had never shared?\nThey were not worthy of the gift he wanted Vou’a to give to Ani. They were not worthy of an epic song by Fitzroy Angursell. They were not worthy of who he, Cliopher Mdang, wanted to be.\nWho he was.","Fitzroy was his beloved not because he was the Sun-on-Earth or the great poet, but because he was funny, and intelligent, and sorrowful, and because he loved.","It came down to this: did he trust Vou’a, trickster-god, Son of Laughter, to have spoken the truth? That there was, deep in his heart, a worthy gift?","He was beyond panic. If he died here, here in the dark, drowning in the dark water, it would be the fulfillment of a lifetime of nightmares. He had always feared he would die by drowning.","He would not stop despite his hatred of diving. He would not stop despite his fear of drowning. He would not stop when the storms capsized him again and again.\nHe would not stop here, in this black depth. He wanted to know what was on the other side.","Is this where you stop?\nNo. He made that promise to himself, as he had made it so many times. No, and no, and no. This was not where he stopped.\nHis fanoa was waiting for him, on the other side of the dark.","For a moment it burned, and then his tears fell upon it, and in a great upwelling of steam the coal went out and left, in the palm of his hand, the second half of a common, ordinary, simple white shell.","“This is the best of you, Cliopher Mdang. Are you truly willing to give it up?”\n“It is the best of what I have been, not who I will be, Buru Vou’a,” he replied, “and I do not lose the fire by giving it to another.”","Cliopher took a deep breath, as if he were diving for nefalao—as if he were diving into the dark water at what he hoped was not the bottom of his heart—and then he took the rope in one hand, stepped over to the outrigger, and deliberately capsized his boat","Cliopher could be patient, terrifyingly patient, but—\n He started to grow perhaps the triflingest bit irritated.","He was Cliopher Mdang of Tahivoa. His island was Loaloa. His dances were Aōteketētana. He was the tanà of the world and the Hands of the Emperor, and he was on a quest.","He nurtured a fine and splendid flame of righteous fury in his heart as he climbed all the way up to the open front door of the House of the Sun.\nHe didn’t bother knocking. His hands were full.","Honestly, it was as if the Sun wasn’t even trying.","He was himself, and he would not be made lesser, not though he stood at the feet of the Sun.","The Sun flung up his hands in a sudden exasperation. “What do you want? I will give you a boon, if only you tell me how you came here without my knowledge!”\nCliopher smiled.","He would know his Fitzroy’s resonant laugh anywhere.","Cliopher could not resist, and passed through the crew of the He’eanka to his lord, his friend, his fanoa.\nThis time he did not hesitate; this time he reached out and embraced him first, as tightly as he had ever held onto anything.\n“Kip,” Fitzroy breathed.","“Shh,” said Fitzroy, rubbing his hand gently down Cliopher’s hair. “Shh. You are home safe.”","“We must go find her, Kip. I dreamed of someone, in that tower at the edge of the Abyss—”\nCliopher’s heart might melt, if it were ice instead of fire.“She might not be your heir.”\n“She might be my daughter,” Fitzroy replied, “My family. My very own.”","The night fell, and other stars came out, unfamiliar constellations that here could be sailed to, could be reached, could prove themselves to be places out of myth.","Cliopher had fallen hand-in hand with a wild mage, a great poet, a legendary hero: together they had fallen out of the Nine Worlds and into the heart of the sky.","“For a thing to be alive,” Tupaia said, “it must change and grow.”","“Fair winds and fair seas, and an island full of all you need when you are ready to land,” Elonoa’a said.\n“And to you,” Fitzroy replied for them both, his voice thick. “And to you.”","What dance did they do here, in this place where time was meaningless because all the markers of time had their own beings?","Cliopher was sure she could see into him. He did not mind: he had loved the constellation with all the love he had ever given that small toy, and he would open his heart to her.","“Even at your most obsequious—” Fitzroy started to laugh. “Your most obsequious lasted all of an hour, that second day you were my secretary.”\n“After I looked you in the eyes.”\n“After you corrected my pronunciation, capped my joke, and ... saved me.”","“For so long all I had was that morning ritual, of you looking at me and saying ‘good morning’ when I looked at you and said ‘good morning’—that was it, Cliopher, that was all I had to remind myself that I was a person, a human being, a man.”","“I knew the first chamber could not be all there was to me,” he said, still looking at the sky. He squeezed Fitzroy’s hand. “I knew because my love for you was not there.”","“Do you ever dream about kissing?”","Cliopher had never, not once, imagined that Fitzroy found him attractive.","He had wanted to be chosen, to be equal, to be the other half of the shell that was half-formed by Fitzroy. He had not wanted ... sex.","El and Auri had made love in the foam at the edge of the sea, the air full of magic, as if they were the night and the day giving form to the lights of the sky.","Cliopher had ... literally never entertained this idea before.","“Fitzroy,” he said, hoarsely.\n“Yes, my lord Mdang,” Fitzroy said, his voice so much his Radiancy’s that Cliopher dropped all the husks from suddenly nerveless fingers.\nNo. He would not let this happen. They had travelled too far together to return to that.","Cliopher had taken the most precious thing he had ever held and dropped it.","The great poet, whom Cliopher loved so very much, but not ... apparently not in the right way. He had always loved things too much or not enough or in the wrong way.","He had never loved anyone as he loved Fitzroy.","“I liked being close to you,” he said. “If you’d still like to ...”\nFitzroy hitched his breath, his eyes widening and then narrowing with speculation. He smiled, a crooked, imperfectly, beautifully human smile as he lifted his hand.","Cliopher leaned forward, obedient to the touch, his hand gripping Fitzroy’s other hand, steadying himself. Fitzroy did have beautiful eyes, and long eyelashes, gently curved.","What greater intimacy could sex possibly give? He had not magically become more intimate with Suzen—or even with Ghilly—because they’d had sex. It didn’t work like that.\nIt didn’t work like that for Cliopher.","Cliopher did not know what to say. He had been so happy last night. He had wanted that for so long ... and it had been just what he’d imagined.\nWhat he’d imagined. Not what Fitzroy had. Not what Fitzroy had wanted.","He had wanted someone who was his, and who would choose him, as his equal, his match, his outrigger, as so much more than friend.","Cliopher said nothing, only wept, his face buried in his hands. He could not bear any witness to his folly and his heartbreak, the death of this dream.","He shook his head at the imperative, dumb with grief, wishing he could howl his emotions in a song or a rising wind, a storm, a wave, a great tumult.","He was not Aurelius, whose magic stirred the sky. He was not Elonoa’a, who could hear the winds whisper of far islands. He was not Fitzroy fucking Angursell, who had written the best poem of an age.\nHe was Cliopher Mdang, and he was not good enough.","“I am misunderstanding something. Talk to me—please. I’m trying but—I’m making things worse—Please. Set me right! You’ve never hesitated before. Don’t let me spoil everything.”","“Cliopher,” Fitzroy said quietly, “what does fanoa mean to you?”\nHe could not answer. His whole life stood in his throat.","Fitzroy hesitated, as if he faced a precipice and did not dare step out.\nNo.\nFitzroy Angursell cared nothing for falling.\nHe hesitated as if he were going to have to put himself back in the cage.","“I thought that was what you wanted,” Fitzroy said. “And what I ... I wanted it, too. I wanted to ... Kip, I thought ... I’ve misunderstood something. What does it mean? You’re so quiet about this ... it’s so important to you. I want to know. Please.”","“That’s not how the Lays use it for them,” he said, very quietly. “It means ... what we say it means ... what I always thought it meant ... is ... someone you love so deeply you would leave the world to sail Sky Ocean for them.”","“A relationship like Vou’a and Ani have. Vou’a raised up the islands for Ani. She brought forth all the living creatures for him. The greatest of friends, we say, thought that’s thin. A euphemism. Fanoa means the person who is worth ... everything.”","“It had always been so important to me that in the stories they were not lovers. That two people could love each other like that, but it didn’t need to be about sex. That you could find someone who was your match. Your other half. Your equal.”","“It’s not as if anyone uses the word. Fanoa, that is. In its social meaning. No one else will have ... lost anything. They’ve all always thought me a fool for taking that meaning. Chasing a viau.” He swallowed, forced out: “It’s very old-fashioned.”","It was not fair that Fitzroy was looking at him even more softly, more tenderly, his face full of something that almost seemed like wonder.","Fitzroy said, still very softly, very gently: “You think of me as your equal?”\nIt was not really a question. Cliopher did not have to answer it. He spoke anyway. “I do.”","“Your equal. Your match. Your ... mirror, even? To bring in a Shaian conceit. The other shoe. The outrigger.” His voice warmed with something like humour, and he squeezed Cliopher’s hands. “Your other hand.”","“Why does it matter what Auri and El made of it?”\nCliopher stared at him. His heart hurt.\n“We are not Aurelius Magnus and Elonoa’a. We are ourselves. Fitzroy and Cliopher.”","Fitzroy smiled. His eyes were full of joy and hope and relief, because this meant they were not alone, this meant they were good enough, this meant they could choose each other.\nHis friend’s eyes. His fanoa’s eyes.\nPlease—","“Cliopher, Kip, you are my right hand, my outrigger, my mirror that shows me my better side. My people do not have a word for this, but yours do.”","“Ask me,” Fitzroy whispered. “Ask me so I can say yes.”","Then Cliopher spoke, his quiet words falling clear as water drops. “You are my fanoa. My beloved. My own. Will you let me be yours?”\n“Not let,” said Fitzroy. “You are. You are.”","“Goodness, my lord Mdang, you say that as if I did not fall half in love with you on sight.” And then he smiled, lifted Cliopher’s hands to his lips, and said: “Yes.” His voice was raw, husky, certain. “Yes. Let’s go home, Kip.”","Cliopher drew in a deep, forceful breath, pushing against the panic and fear wanting to rise in his gorge. He would trust in Fitzroy’s magic. He would.\nThis time he was not falling alone; neither of them were.","What was he supposed to say, if Fitzroy told him he really was a god?\nHe wasn’t. Cliopher knew that. And even if he were ... well, Buru Tovo loved a god, in person and as a person, and was loved in return. It could be done.","“It was simpler up there, wasn’t it?”\n“Simple as the most important things. It’s like living inside a poem.” Fitzroy gave him one of those sly, wry, glinting grins. “Which even I can find tedious eventually.”","“Trust me,” Fitzroy said, smiling like the sunrise, like all the lost magic and wonder of Sky Ocean, like the embers of sunlight burning in the fire-pot. “If my fanoa is so fantastically competent, I can’t be entirely useless.”","“I was wondering,” Fitzroy said after a moment, “whether there was a special efela for fanoa.”","Fitzroy shifted position, lifted up a wooden comb with four widely-spaced teeth, and asked, quite neutrally, “Would you like me to comb your hair?”","Cliopher wanted to feel nervous about explaining this, but his fanoa’s hands were gentle on his hair, untangling the knots, reforming the braids, and all Cliopher could think of was the long years of devoted service and loving patronage.","Cliopher could never go back to that devoted service of vassal and lord, not when they could be equals, fanoa, mirror and match.","“I couldn’t put anyone in this position. No matter how necessary the good for the many. I couldn’t.” He was silent for a moment, looking at the beautiful antique furnishings. “And how many people died in the Fall because I couldn’t?”","“If I die first,” he said, “cremate me and keep the ashes until—until—until they can be scattered with yours. So you can be free but you don’t have to be—alone—we can sail with the Ancestors together—”","He almost wished they had the Empire of Astandalas back, simply so they could destroy it even more thoroughly.","And knowing where he was, where he had been, he knew exactly how to go home at last.","“It is my hair and I shall wear it precisely as I wish. Which at the moment, is how you’ve done it.”","“What is he going to do, Kip?” Fitzroy whispered. “Ludvic’s always been so ... steady. Ever since I woke up after the Fall, he’s been there, no matter what. He’s so loyal. How can I face him and tell him that the emperor he loved was a—How can I tell him?”","“You tell him the truth. You are Fitzroy Angursell and you are also Artorin Damara.”\n“That name means nothing to me.”\nAlthough that could not possibly be true—there was far too much venom in his tone for it to be true—Cliopher left it alone.","“Ludvic loves you, not the Emperor.”\n“You don’t know that.”\n“He told me.”\nThat silenced Fitzroy, who knew as well as Cliopher that Ludvic far preferred saying nothing to lying.","Cliopher looked at the basket containing the mirimiri of Ani, the shimmering cloth so subtle and fine his hands could barely hold it, his eyes barely see it, and he shivered with a deep fear and wonder at what he might waken.","He cleared his throat. “If you wish to be his Radiancy—”\n“No. I—I can’t, Kip. Not yet.”\n'Not ever' was obvious in the sudden distress in his eyes.","“Kip, we both have plenty of flame pearls. I’d rather have a thousand common, ordinary white clamshells strung together than all the jewels in my treasury, because we could find those together.”","“You don’t have to prove anything. Not to me, not to your Buru Tovo—who is immensely proud of you—not to Elonoa’a—not to Tupaia—not to anyone.”","Fitzroy leaned forward and rested his forehead on his, just for a moment, and then he whispered, “Don’t drown yourself to make a point, Cliopher Mdang. You don’t need to be anything but who you are.”","“Oh, come on,” Fitzroy said in Shaian once they had settled down with their coconuts and were waiting for Haunui to come around. “That was hilarious. I love how your cousins occasionally faint with surprise. It’s most gratifying.”","“I find that unfathomable,” Fitzroy declared. “My family tree looks like a cordon-pruned fruit tree, whereas yours is like one of those vines that runs underground as well as overground, and pops up in all sorts of strange places.”","“Don’t put your hand in the water,” Cliopher said in exasperation when he saw his friend preparing to reach down. “Those sharks will take it for a fish if you’re not careful.”\n“Well—”\n“No.”\nFitzroy laughed and obediently sat up. “Spoilsport.”","“You can do this,” Fitzroy murmured softly. “You’ve been to the House of the Sun. Own it.”","“Tovo always has said that you’d come back when it was time,” the old man said. “I should know better than to wager against him.”","“I think,” Fitzroy said, his voice very low, and yet ... certain, too, “that you have tried very hard to be of use, Kip. You give and give and give so that you can feel as if you are part of things, don’t you?”","“What a thought,” Fitzroy murmured, holding himself very still for a moment. Cliopher settled himself down on the deck, facing where his friend (his fanoa) leaned against the mast. “The idea,” he went on, “that we could do something because we wanted to.”","“I’ve had one hot bath since we left Basil’s inn. Washing with a bucket of water in your ancestral village was fine, I guess, but it’s not—it’s not the same. You know what I mean, don’t you? Conju is going to despair over my skin. It’s peeling, Kip.”","“Cliopher. Cliopher Mdang. Kip. What is my area of expertise?”\n“High drama.”\nFitzroy nodded judiciously. “Exactly.”\n“I don’t think my story needs any more drama than it already has, Fitzroy.”\n“Kip! Honestly, this is why Ylette and I had to dress you.”","“Cliopher, trust me. You are worthy, and you deserve to be seen for the brilliant man you are. Your people are waiting for you to step up and take your place. It’s time.”","“Kip, let me help you. I’m your fanoa, am I not? Your mirror and your match, your equal? The other keel of your vaha, your other hand, the other half of the shell?”","“Well then,” Fitzroy said. “You don’t need to be something other than you are, Kip. You just need to be fully yourself.” His voice went soft. “Both halves, Kip. The carefully contained embers and the blazing fire.”","“He’s your Buru Tovo, too. It’s not really a familial title ... and even if it were you're—you’d still be allowed.”","“Vinyë’s made friends with my sister Melissa? How wonderful! What a splendid thing, Kip—the idea of Conju and your mother and your sister and your niece ...”","He looked at Fitzroy, who was watching him intently. “Would you light it for me, Fitzroy?”\nFitzroy drew in a sharp breath. “Kip. You can’t mean that.”\nCliopher did not know if he could smile, but he nodded. His voice was hoarse. “Please.”","The wood caught, and crackled, and for a moment Cliopher touched the fire, as he had always wanted to touch it, as if it were a living thing tame to his hand.","“Because it’s a tower?”","Was that still an issue? Was what Cliopher had offered not enough, after all? Should he ask?\nBut Fitzroy was smiling again, pleased with the space, the house, and ... and he would say something, wouldn’t he? If he wanted—","“Will you be my ke’e, Cliopher Mdang?”\n“As you are mine,” Cliopher said. “My fanoa.”","“You will show me how to love this tower, won’t you?”","“It was Saya Dorn’s shrine,” Cliopher said intently. “Not mine. Never mine.”","“I promise you,” he said softly, “that particular painting matters to me because it is the one that told me the ke’ea of my life. Not for any other reason.”","“Kip, there is an iguana in the bathhouse. No—let me rephrase that. There is an iguana in the bath. My bath. With me. An iguana.”","“There you are, Cousin Kip, your boss thinks you should let me have agency and personal judgment in order to prevent the collapse of society.”","“Sunset’s a bit later than the Palace ... Don’t get lost?”\n“I could find you anywhere,” Fitzroy said softly.","Fitzroy scuttled over and embraced him fiercely. “There’s no shame,” he whispered, “in loving something, however big, however small.”","“I didn’t think it was anything to be ashamed of. I thought it was something rather fine, in fact.”","“Perhaps we should reconsider, if it’s not something you feel can be announced. I’ve had enough of being a secret.”","“Fitzroy,” he said, looking into his eyes. “I saw you. You could have told me at any point and I would have believed you, wholly and utterly.”","“You know what it is to have a truth too big, too real, too much the ground of your soul. That is what I feel for you, for calling you my fanoa.”","“I’m sorry I’m ... like this. Too much, and not enough.” He managed a shaky laugh. “I always have been, you know.”\nFitzroy’s thumbs moved against his cheeks. “So have I,” he said softly. “Fanoa, you know.”","He gently tugged on Cliopher’s head, and they touched their foreheads together. “The other half of your heart.”\n“I am the other half of yours,” Cliopher said.","“You know, I’m lying here thinking, ‘What would Jullanar do?’ But the answer is ‘healthy communication’ and ‘ask useful questions.’”\n“We’re doomed,” said Cliopher without missing a beat, and was gratified when Fitzroy laughed properly, out loud.","“I refuse to trap you. I refuse to hold you here. I refuse to bind you, even with my love. It is—I want it to be—a gift. Freely offered.”\nFitzroy squeezed his hand back. “Freely taken,” he said, very quietly.","“I used to be the solid, staid, responsible bureaucrat of bureaucrats, who could be trusted with the world’s government.”\n“You’ve never been that boring,” Fitzroy returned, “and I would still trust you with the world.”","“Do you want to go?” Cliopher pushed himself up onto one elbow and looked at his fanoa frankly. “Fitzroy. Do you want to?”\nSlowly, Fitzroy nodded. “Yes. Kip. Yes.”","“Rhodin is going to be so pleased with this development,” Fitzroy declared, extending his hand to see if the lizard would sniff it. The iguana ignored him entirely, even when he stroked its side with a gentle finger. “Our very own household lizard.”","“You saw me,” he whispered. “I would have lost myself, Kip. I was so close to just letting myself float away.”","“O gods, Kip, I have two legal identities, and neither of them are truly me.”","“I was locked in my fucking tower like that Marwn who died and I was supposed to have died there, like she did, nothing but a vessel for the Empire.”","Cliopher hugged him more tightly, and then thought better of it and kissed him on the top of his bent head, in a part of the spiralling hair.\nFitzroy shuddered convulsively, and clutched at his hand.","“When I look at you—whenever I’ve looked at you—I’ve never seen only a mask and nothing underneath it.”\n“That can’t be true,” Fitzroy scoffed.\n“It is,” he said, quietly, intensely.","“The man who met my eyes when I made a joke and capped it? The man who asked me to be Viceroy with a terrible prank about the Duke of Ikiano? The man who vocally forbade Ylette to dress me in satin or the colour olive, in front of multiple people?”","“The man who cared so much for his people he was willing to stay in a cage until he was sure they were free? The man who learned Islander in secret just to please me? The man who always, always, always listened to me?”","“I can only ask you the questions, and listen to your answers.”\n“Kip, don’t ... Kip, I can’t ...”\n“You can,” he said relentlessly, as confidently as he had crossed Sky Ocean, as he had climbed that long stair, as he had lived in the world. “You must.”","“You believed me, didn’t you, that there was a six-foot iguana in the bath-house.”\nThat was an unexpected sequitur, but Cliopher went with it. “Of course.”\n“People don’t, you know. Believe me when I tell such a strange and ridiculous truth as that.”","“Pali said—”\n“Pali Avramapul strikes me as a person who does not like to feel confused and guilty.”","“That sounds like more of what-would-Jullanar-do,” Cliopher said. “The useful questions and healthy communication and so on.”\n“She’s appalling.” Fitzroy’s voice dropped. “I wish she were here.”","“Do you think Pali or Sardeet or Jullanar or Masseo love you any less than my sister or my cousin Basil love me?” Cliopher interrupted gently. “They want you to be happy, Fitzroy, and they thought you were before.”","“Many of us have a more fragile happiness in our twenties than we would like anyone else to know.”","“I know you don’t like that title, but it was always an endearment. No one outside your household called you that. It is a name of love and respect.”","“I’ll be the best fanoa, you’ll see.”\nCliopher grinned. “You do have some unusually stiff competition there—”\n“I cannot believe you’re making dick jokes about Auri and El.”","“Vou’a raised up the islands for Ani,” Cliopher said, laughing.\nFitzroy turned to him, face stern. “And you don’t think I, Fitzroy Angursell, can come up with something equally impressive? They may be gods but I am your favourite poet.”","“Does it hurt?”\n“Nothing to speak of.”\n“Nonsense,” Fitzroy said, with a sly smile, and he lifted Cliopher’s hand to his lips. “I’ll kiss it better for you.”","“Who are you?” he whispered again.\nHe held a fire in his hand, that living fire his fanoa had made for him, held between their clasped hands.\n“Ask me again,” Fitzroy said, “A third time, Kip. Ask me the questions.”","“Beloved,” he said, “what is your name?”\nAnd all the world stopped.\nThe whale vanished below the surface; the viau settled in the hollow troughs of the waves; the waves themselves did not crash upon the stones, but were still.","“My name,” his fanoa said, solid as the earth, “is Fitzroy Angursell.”","“Are you doing this,” he whispered, his hand clenching around Fitzroy’s in atavistic terror.\n“I am not,” replied Fitzroy, with exhilaration in his voice. “We are being invited.”","“Do you trust me, Cliopher Mdang?”\n“I do,” said Cliopher, for he did; he did.\n“This is a song, a story, a legend for us. For us.”\n“I trust you.”\n“I can take us down there by magic, if you will let me?”\n“I trust you. Yes.”","“Come with me,” Fitzroy said, his voice suddenly warm, delighted, enticing—as enticing as every story—as that picture had been—\nAnd then he was dissolving, his bones and flesh falling away, his hands no longer grasping anything but air—\nAnd he was flying.","Cliopher found his voice. “That was ... was ... matter for a song.”\nFitzroy smiled at him, slow and secret, his delight welling as slowly as the light. “Yes. One day.”\n“I will help you,” Cliopher promised.","“I’ve discovered something, Kip.”\n“Have you?”\n“I want to have adventures with you for the rest of my life.”","A flicker of an eyebrow, and all Cliopher’s fear evaporated. Fitzroy would keep him safe; or they would fight the dark and the cold together. Hand in hand, as Ani and Vou’a had once walked, the shoreline and the sea.","“You’re so beautiful,” Cliopher blurted, and when Fitzroy gave him an incredulous look, refused to do anything but be as earnest as his heart wished. “With the shell in your hand and the magic in your face and your ... your ... everything ...”","“Let us walk in legends, Kip Mdang.”\nCliopher’s heart was hammering. “Yes,” he breathed. “Yes. What—What is your island, Fitzroy Angursell?”\n“This one.” Fitzroy dropped his hands.\nThe fire at the heart of the world rose up.","He gripped the shell in his hand, himself held safe by his fanoa, and he looked up at the golden eyes so full of magic, so full of brilliant intellect and indomitable will, so full of the fundamental joy of creation.","Fitzroy knew what he was doing. He was smiling, and he was raising the fire around them, and he was the rock that held fast, and the sun and the stars in the sky, and Cliopher was as safe in his arms as Fitzroy had ever been in his.","He stared at Fitzroy, whose face was exhilarated, dazzling as the sun, and he thought that he had thought he could not love that man any more, and he had been wrong.","Fitzroy had made the world a place where this could happen.\n“Thank you,” Cliopher said, dazed, unable to do anything but smile.\n“You’re welcome,” Fitzroy replied with a royal graciousness, and then his lips twitched.","“Kip! Look what I just did!”\n“You made an island.”\n“I made an island.”\nThey grinned at each other, each as astonished by the magnitude of Fitzroy’s daring as a person could be.","Fitzroy was dazzled with his magic, smiling with such power in him that Cliopher felt that inner flame rise up just a little further. He said, “Fitzroy. You made me an island.”","He could only grab onto Fitzroy and embrace him as tightly as Fitzroy had held him, rising up out of the depths of the sea, tears running freely from his eyes in pure, singing joy.","“Not even Auri ever made an island for El,” Cliopher said.\n“I thank you to remember that we are not Auri and El, and we are setting our own grand example—exemplar, even—for those who come after us.”","“You made me an island.”\nHis fanoa’s eyes were sparkling like the sea. “I did.” And then, with a small, brilliant grin. “Not just for you.”\n“You made us an island.”","Fitzroy lifted his half-shell up against the sun. “Look at this colour. Scarlet and a subtle gold.”\nRed—scarlet, even, that was a good colour for both of them. “Fire and the Red Company,” Cliopher said. His heart could not take much more of this, surely?","“What—what is your island?” Cliopher smiled at him, just a little, just enough.\n“My island is Loaloa. What is yours?”\nFitzroy drew in a deep breath, and his voice was full of joy. “My island is Navanoa.”\n“Perfect,” Cliopher breathed.","“Don’t ask me the third question,” Fitzroy said, as Cliopher was about to turn his head to do so. “I don’t have a clever answer for it yet.”","One day that would be a beach, and his descendants would run their boats up to this island, this Navanoa, with a line or two from the Lays in their mouths.\nA new star in the sky, and a new island in the Ring.\nIt was impossible, and yet it was true.","He did not even care that they had no food or fresh water or shade or shelter or means of leaving. They had a new island and a pair of shells for the first beads on their efanoa, and ... and that was enough","“I—we—Fitzroy and I—my lord, that is, but—no, he’s my fanoa—we sailed Sky Ocean to the House of the Sun.” Cliopher was quite proud of himself for managing to get that all out.","Cliopher felt too sozzled by surprise and magic and pure happiness to answer that. “I have no idea,” he said. “Fitzroy made me an island this morning. I cannot think about philosophy right now. I have only poetry in my heart.”","“We were very good,” Cora repeated. “We didn’t throw Bertie overboard for not telling us that your beloved lord, your very dear friend, your Aurelius Magnus, was actually Fitzroy Angursell.”","“You can do better than that, Kip,” Ghilly said. “He raised an island for you, the least you could do is, I don’t know—”\n“Hang a star?” Cliopher replied, and winked at her when she stopped, flustered. “I have a great deal to tell you all.”","Toucan rolled his eyes. “Bertie, come help me carry Kip’s beloved ... renegade.”","“You know that you were going to be in the Lays from your work in the world, right?”\n“I didn’t fall into Sky Ocean on purpose, Toucan.”\nToucan laughed; and Ghilly said, “As if you wouldn’t have if you’d known it was an option!”","“You deserve each other,” Ghilly declared. “Because that sounds totally mad, I hope you know that?”\nHe grinned sheepishly at her. “I know.”","“I’m certain—absolutely certain—that you are aware of the first, fundamental rule.”\n“Secure your boat. Yes. I am aware.”\n“And yet—”\nCliopher sighed.“And yet it is very clearly not here. I am also aware.”\n“I thought you might be,” Toucan said, grinning.","“It’s apparently incapable of being removed. He hoped their last efforts—which I think involved putting it on a trading ship bound across the Wide Seas—would work. But it’s got some sort of magic, and it arrived back just after you returned to Solaara.”","Fitzroy appeared dazed. “Have they adopted me?”\nCliopher took his arm, and turned him gently to continue along the canal. “Yes. I think you’ll find they have.”\n“What an amazing thing,” Fitzroy declared.","“You called him beloved,” Ludvic said quietly. “I heard you. You’ve loved him for a long time, Cliopher, but you did not call him that before you left.”","“My people do not name the dead.”","“Ludvic. Ludvic. My dear Ludvic. Masseo is going to be—I am so—” He laughed, and tried to smile, and then let go of Ludvic so he could cover his face.. “I am overcome.”","“It was ... perhaps it was wrong of me, but I ... I always thought ... in my culture, it is a good thing, to stand beside your ... uncle.”","“As if I were your father’s brother. As if we were truly ...” He didn’t finish, or perhaps couldn’t.\nBut Cliopher heard the unspoken word, and so did Ludvic.\n“Yes,” he said, hardly any more loudly. “As if we were.”\n“All this time?”\n“Always.”","“Kip, you’re ridiculous. I know you know this, but it has to be said.” Enya shook her head. “I do love you. Especially how ridiculous you are.”","If you can be your own sort of fanoa, and ‘Auri and El’—cannot believe you have a nickname for Elonoa’a, that is impossible—anyway, if Elonoa’a and Aurelius Magnus can be their own sort of fanoa, then so can Galen and I.”","“The other day, Kip and I went to go see what might lie under that new star, the one he hung in the sky, and since there wasn’t an island there I raised one for him ...”\n“As you do,” Mardo said, his lips twitching.","“It seems appropriate,” Ludvic said phlegmatically, “that you would manage to find, or be given, the shell of an extinct kind of mollusc to be representative of your love for each other.”","“There is iconoclasm and then there is fucking the icon.”","“There is another part of me that acknowledges (what have you people done to me) that it would probably do him a world of good to get done and also that you’d be the best person to do it, by which I mean him.”","“Were you hoping I wouldn’t notice your arrival? The house called me, and this is not a negotiation for Cliopher alone.”","“I am a velio, I know,” Fitzroy Angursell, the last Emperor of Astandalas, said to the Islander god, in the Islander language, “and yet I have studied your ways as best I can, for love of this man, my friend, my stalwart counsellor, my fanoa.”","“You, little mage, little sunling, my dear little one, my tirului—” Cliopher shifted, and the god cackled. “Too much? Still, it’s all true. I would gladly adopt you as one of mine, fanoa of my husband’s grand-nephew, but you are well claimed.”","“Oh, you are a sly one! You can be one of mine too, if you like, if no one has adopted you yet?”\n“I am part of the household of your kinsman,” Ludvic said sturdily.\n“So you are,” said Vou’a. “So you are.”","Cliopher blinked. “I’ve never heard that story.”\n“You wouldn’t have,” Ludvic replied imperturbably. “Not for everyone’s ears, you know. But this is a matter for ...” He hesitated, and then he smiled radiantly at them both. “For family.”","“Kip’s never read any philosophy of magic, he always used to say ‘why do I need to know about magic, I have the Lays’, but he’s also the man who said ‘just don’t think about time,’and really, Fitzroy, he can’t get his own way all the time, can he?”","“This is very good. Because I bet you—oh! You’re also the lord emperor, aren’t you?”\n“Alas, yes.”\n“No, no, that’s perfect, because you know about magic.”","“No,” Ludvic said, vastly amused. “It’s not adventurous enough, is it? For either of you.”\n“All these years in which Kip valiantly pretended to be reasonable,” Fitzroy said, shaking his head, but he was grinning. “His true colours coming out at last.”","“Yes, yes, Tanaea does indeed sound splendid.” Fitzroy shifted in his chair. “Even if she’s the right person, I don’t think I can handle returning yet, Ludvic.”\n“I know,” he said very simply.","“Kip. Kip. Cliopher. I don’t have a poem in my mind right now.”\n“Don’t you?” Cliopher sang the notes of the melody Fitzroy had been humming when they went to create Navanoa.\n“You and your challenge-songs,” he grumbled.","“Do I tell the lords of my court that I have spent the entirety of my time playing elaborate games? Do I say that I spent half my time making up dirty limericks about them?”\n“Did you, my lord?” Cliopher asked demurely.\nDemurely, but the challenge was there","“There once was a wizard called Dorn, whom no one around here dared scorn, for her familiar companion was eerily reptilian—in fact, the only iguana in town!”","“Damn you and your challenge-songs! What do you want of me? A dozen terrible limericks?”\n“As you wish, my lord.”\n“Do you see an iguana?”","The Amboloyan Prince, Rufus—hmm—a hero of kicking up a fuss—pompous, dull, boring—we’re forever imploring: MUST his speeches be always superfluous?”","It was not magic that was running through Fitzroy’s veins now, or only that common, ordinary, splendid magic of words—and the disciplined imagination of a great poet who had forced himself to close the door of his heart to protect his soul.","Cliopher looked straight back at his fanoa with a silent 'well? Is this where you stop?'\nFitzroy narrowed his eyes, and they held there, perfectly still. Intent. The challenge reverberating in the air between them: the tinder burning brightly.","“It’s like that, is it?” Fitzroy said, in a very imperial-sounding voice, his magic slowly welling up into the room, limning everything with a sense of buzzing urgency, of the sudden possibility that everything might come alive and become something new.","They held each other’s gazes: the great mage with his golden eyes full of magic, and Cliopher who was an ordinary man but who had looked full upon the face of the Sun and not been blinded.","He held the spark Fitzroy had struck, and he held Fitzroy’s eyes.\nFitzroy was glittering and magnificent and every inch an emperor, a folk hero, a legend. His voice could have seduced the Moon or half the Nine Worlds into following him.","“What, my lord Mdang? An island wasn’t enough for you?”","Above them there was a jangle as if the wind had blown through the glass floats in the solarium. The same gust whipped through the room, scattering the limericks and sending a spray of sparks up out of the brazier.\nVery deliberately, Cliopher smiled.","“Hear, children of the sun and of the wind, of the emperor Aurelius Magnus and his fanoa from across the sea: sing of their deeds of magic, their high-hearted courage, their love that crested the very sky, and weep for what glory once was in the world.”","Cliopher tried, he really did, but when Fitzroy started to compare the dimensions of El’s prick to various kinds of bananas he could not help himself, and sniggered.","“You disagree with the plantain? Trust me.”\n“To know what is most poetically appealing?”\n“That too, of course,” Fitzroy replied very serenely.\nCliopher set down his pen. “You cannot mean that the way that sounds.”","“No, no, you mistake me!” Fitzroy’s voice was full of barely suppressed mirth. “I am not writing an erotic scene. This is going to be an epic, Kip. With all the details.”","“I knew you were Fitzroy Angursell,” she added, greatly satisfied. “I knew it. And you so carefully didn’t deny it.”\n“It was all I could do not to fall upon your neck in gratitude,” Fitzroy said, with a light tone.","“I was not involved in measuring anyone’s penis,” Cliopher exclaimed in exasperation, which was the point where Ludvic finally broke down into laughter.","“Aya inDovo Delanis is here. With Fitzroy. They’re talking about techniques for writing sex scenes,” Cliopher said.\n“Oh, I can’t possibly miss that!” Ghilly said.","“I’m not providing comparative measurements,” Cliopher said desperately. “You can get your own banana scale.”\n“I beg your pardon?” Toucan said. “I am fascinated by what could possibly have led to that response.”","“Kip Mdang, did you acquire a house so the Red Company could live next door?”","“Is there anything you want me to avoid saying?”\n“I trust you,” Ludvic said, very simply. “And him.”\n“Fitzroy,” Cliopher murmured, gently teasing.\nLudvic smiled. “Fitzroy.”","“One of the greatest joys of my life was the expression on your face when I asked you if you wanted to be Duke of Ikiano and you refused with language that would make a sailor blush.”","“Of course we can ask Jullanar’s help. She’s part of your family, your culture ... our lives.”","Fitzroy gave Cliopher a very brilliant look and carefully moved the flower to his right ear.\nCliopher felt a wash of some nameless emotion—some indescribable wonder, some intense humility, some astonishing gratitude, some sort of awe.","“Don’t hurt yourself,” Toucan whispered. “He’ll still be there tomorrow.”","“Dad said I shouldn’t call you Uncle Fitzroy but you are, aren’t you? More or less?”\nFitzroy, visibly choked up, nodded speechlessly.\nClio nodded with complete unconcern for upending someone’s world. “Great. I thought so.”","If there were a party down in the green—and if he and Fitzroy were announcing they were fanoa—(and both of those things were true)—well. Perhaps it was a good thing that Féonie and Franzel and Conju had insisted he bring half court costume with him.","“Kip.” Fitzroy looked him up and down, frankly appreciative, and let the door swing shut behind him as he came into the middle of the room. “Cliopher Lord Mdang, Viceroy of Zunidh and tana-tai of the Wide Seas Islanders.”\n“Your fanoa.”","“I would like you to have this, as a token of my esteem, a promise of my affection, an affirmation of my readiness to follow your star wherever you wander with it, an acknowledgement of my willingness to raise an island for you whenever you need one.”","“And ...” Fitzroy took a deep breath. “And a statement of something I have never quite dared say in its full simplicity before, which is that I love you.”","“That’s the Imperial Seal.”\n“It is,” said Fitzroy. “And you know very well that there is not another person in all the Nine Worlds and the lands beyond whom I would trust with it.”","Cliopher had come to a kind of truce with her, but it was definitely easier for both of them to be polite after breakfast.","“I’m in the company of someone who would very much like to meet you both.”"],"atfotsbonus":["#atfotsbonusquotes#\n\nAt the Feet of the Sun"],"atfotsbonusquotes":["He lay in bed, clutching his quilt, shivering and frightened and thinking he was over thirty years old and surely shouldn’t be either.","“They’ll be searching for us.”\n“Or at least for you and Kip,” the woman replied, her voice amused.\nSo they knew him. The relief was—was there. He let himself relax a trifle. They knew his name. They had lit a fire. He was, presumably, safe. And he knew that voice—surely he did.","“Right then,” he said briskly, smiling at them with what he hoped was convincing cheerfulness. “I am presuming that I am more or less married to my job, in that case? Please tell me I do something interesting.”","Surely he hadn’t just ... given up? Given up on all his dreams? All of them? If he wasn’t tanà, if he wasn’t married to Ghilly, if he hadn’t succeeded in anything—he was stubborn, that was what he was. Even when he couldn’t think straight he was stubborn. He never gave up.","Before he could quite begin to panic, Rhodin said, “You’re the Viceroy of Zunidh.”\nWhich—well! What a punchline! Kip liked him better already.","The injured man, Pikabe, woke up, expressed mild surprise at losing his arm, and asked urgently after “Lord Mdang.”\nKip was so overwhelmed by the fact that Pikabe pronounced his name correctly that he did not, at first, register the significance of the title.","Sir. Lord Mdang. A salute.\n(But ‘Viceroy of Zunidh’ wasn’t even a real title.)\n“I ... I am having a few memory problems,” he admitted.","He shivered and could not resist the urge to do something as an offering to the gods of this place, who had shown him such favour as to protect him from that.","“Would you tell me a story of your home, sir?” Pikabe asked after a few minutes. “I ... I like your accent.”\nNo one liked Kip’s accent. In five years in Astandalas, no one had ever had a kind word to say of it. It was too sharp, too nasal, too strong, too rural, too unintelligible, too barbaric.","“We did not have kings, the Islanders. We had chiefs, and sometimes, when there was a need, the people came together and chose a paramount chief to speak for all. The last of the Paramount Chiefs was Elonoa’a ...”","Pikabe fell asleep somewhere in the middle, but by then the others were listening, and Rhodin asked him to keep going, an odd light in his eyes as Kip struggled to find the words to describe the friendship of Elonoa’a and Aurelius Magnus.","Rhodin’s pot and cups had apparently been an item of mockery when they were going on a simple four-hour hike, but Kip could not blame Rhodin for his smug pleasure whenever they were able to make something hot.","“They said you must have been taken by the mountain, but I was sure you couldn’t have been—you’re too good for the mountain to take you—and I was right!”\nKip, to whom this was addressed, smiled even more weakly. As far as compliments went, it was a doozy.","“Zigu, do you have extra paddles?” “I have one extra—my sister usually comes with me,” the boy admitted. “But she had to stay back so no one worried I was gone.”\nOh, how much Kip had been like this!","People kept coming up to him, crying, laughing, weeping, some of them wanting to touch his hands.","Can he afford proper care? What will happen to him after?”\nRhodin stared at him. Actually stared.","He wasn’t ashamed for caring for Pikabe, who had clearly been injured in his service. Whatever that meant. Whatever resources he commanded—his older self commanded—he had an obligation.","“That’s the Palace,” Kip said stupidly.\n“Yes,” Rhodin said patiently. He’d explained this, but Kip hadn’t fully grasped what he meant when he said the Palace was moved from Astandalas to Zunidh. It was a fundamentally impossible idea; Kip hadn’t been able to hold it in his mind at all.","Those patterns he had not quite recognized in the cloth were the Mdang patterns, familiar from baskets and pottery and body paint, woven into the fabric of the power of the Viceroy.","This was surely not a real future. The idea that he would find Ani’s tear, earn that five-ranked efela of flame pearls, warrant those surmounting superb bird-of-paradise eye-feathers—","So this was the Emperor of Astandalas’s personal physician, called to attend to Kip. Of course it was.\nIt was becoming more and more apparent that this was some wild hallucination.","These were the clothes belonging to the older Kip. The one who lived, lest he forget, in the Lord of Zunidh’s apartments. Kip touched the silk, shimmering a rich, royal blue, and felt the gawkish clodpoll every Astandalan had called him.","It was hard, knowing that they were all looking at him and wanting his other self. Five years in Astandalas, grinding himself to the bone in his attempts to do something, and here he was, between Vinyë and his Uncle Lazo, just as if it were a dinner at home, and ... still not what they wanted.","He smiled weakly and tried to rein in his tongue, for every time he spoke whoever he was speaking to would look briefly surprised before the realization flashed across their features that he was still, still, not their Kip.","Prince Rufus duly showed up. Kip hated him instantly.\nWhy exactly Prince Rufus was so insistent on seeing him he didn’t quite understand, for the man clearly disliked him almost equally.","“It’s Mdang,” he said sharply.\nPrince Rufus stopped and visibly swallowed affront. “I beg your pardon?”\n“It’s Mdang,” Kip said, enunciating carefully. Prince Rufus stared blankly at him. “Rhymes with hang, tang, sang, oh, Fitzroy Angursell.”","Kip began to understand why he was in these apartments, called the viceroy, wept over by the people ... why he was such a disappointment, when they asked him a question expecting some brilliant response, and all he could do was be increasingly sarcastic in defence.","It still seemed so much more likely that this was some odd hallucination. No one actually achieved their most high-flying dreams.","“This wasn’t made here, in the Vangavaye-ve,” Cora decided. “Someone sailed it here.”\nGhilly gave her a speculative look. “New research project?”\nCora grinned. “New research project.”","By the time they were halfway to the secretary Ghilly had started to sweat with nerves, and was frantically trying to come up with some real reason for them to have sought an audience with the Viceroy, some grave and sensible and adult purpose for their visit.","“I am Ghillian Poyë, this is my husband Toucan Nevan, and our friend Falbert Kindraa. We are all from Gorjo City in the Vangavaye-ve and have come to pay our respects to our countryman. The Viceroy,” she clarified when the secretary looked dumbfounded.","In his letters he was their Kip, funny and wry and affectionate and not, ever, displaying the power that his garments and seat and posture and presence all demonstrated so ruthlessly.","From behind her the first secretary announced their names, but he had not even finished saying “Poyë” when Cliopher Lord Mdang, Viceroy of Zunidh, dropped all his professional decorum and launched himself out of his throne to engulf her in his arms.","His deep wish might not have been obvious to someone who did not know him well, but Ghilly had been intending to marry him once, and she could see that behind the now-more-professional smile was a real fear that they had not come for him, for Kip, but only for the Viceroy of Zunidh.","How had she not realized that Kip would be Kip, titles and extravagant clothing and importance and power notwithstanding?","Ghilly laughed, suddenly able to understand why Kip had so many people in his household. His family home had been full of people of all ages, aunts and uncles and cousins and all their various friends. This was his version of that.","Ghilly would really have liked it if, at some point in the last few years, Kip had actually explained that he was the head of the government. It was the sort of thing, she thought, one ought to know about one’s former fiancée and near-best friend.","Young Kip had been brilliant like a lightning bolt, and almost as unstoppably obvious.","No matter what they told him he had done he only laughed at the sheer absurdity of it.

Persnickety, precise, sober, exquisite of dress, careful of speech—these were all things Conju was himself and was disposed to admire in others.","What was everyone thinking? Conju thought, a fierce protectiveness leaping into his throat. This man was no divinity: he was sick.","The Master of Offices was a creature of the Ouranatha, so Conju disapproved of him on principle; and he was a minging sort of person, a bootlicker and a toady, so he disliked him personally; and he was harming his Radiancy, and so Conju loathed him professionally.","It was a pity that it was not the court of Conju’s father’s day, when discreet assassination would have been ... well, not countenanced, of course, officially no one ever countenanced assassination, but mostly ignored.\nThere were far too few courtiers now for anyone’s death to go unregarded, alas.","His Radiancy was doing much better with Conju as a stable force in his life. But Conju could see, even if no one else could, how much it chafed his lord to be so ... constrained.","Conju’s closest thing to a friend amongst the guards was Ludvic Omo. Omo was hardly one of Conju’s usual set—he was, in fact, very clearly a rural nobody who had found his way forward in the Guard—but they shared a certain cautious care for their mutual lord.","He watched his Radiancy swim in his bathing pool with his heart full of fury that the new secretary had dared look and so stabbed the mortal heart of the Sun-on-Earth.","Conju pondered, and eventually decided that just as one ill in body needed simple, easily digestible pablum in his convalescence, so too, surely, did one injured in spirit and soul need the equivalent.\nOne day, therefore, Conju took a risk, and offered his Radiancy a choice.","“Which parure would you prefer today, Glorious One?”\nHe watched his Radiancy’s body grow even stiller. For a long moment there was nothing, just silence and stillness, a no-longer-a-taboo breached.\nThen he watched the soul of his lord flow into him.","His name, spoken in such a voice; a simple choice offered and made; one glimpse of the famous lion eyes he had never believed were real.\n“Very good, Glorious One,” he said, and pretended not to be shaken.\nIt had been a long time since he had last fallen in love with someone.","No one thought Conju had a sense of humour. He had always thought he didn’t have one. But this man was laughing, not at him precisely, but ... dare he think it? with him?","“I have been set several impossible tasks,” the other man offered in return.\n“Impossible?” Conju asked, lightly teasing.\n‘Someone’s secretary’ smiled slowly, with a sort of secret pride. “Perhaps not entirely.”","“I have been given to understand,” Conju said, “that you are his Radiancy’s secretary.”\nThe man gave Conju an ironic but perfectly executed bow. “Cliopher Mdang. Sayo, but of course you knew that.”\n","Conju did not waste time and energy being angry or hurt.\nWhat did it matter to him, anyway, if his Radiancy’s commoner secretary was such a prude as that?","“Do tell,” his Radiancy said at last, his tone warming.\nConju smiled as he returned to the anointing, and spun out all the best court gossip he’d heard that week.\nHe would not think about how his Radiancy must have felt when his secretary lifted those sly, laughing eyes to meet his.","He was tired; his Radiancy was tired; everyone was tired. Even the gossips had little to say about Sayo Mdang, save that he was (as usual) everywhere and getting his nose into everything.","The ink was a very dark blue, which Sayo Mdang probably didn’t know was a minor solecism—one only used colours to friends or family.","He had done his research for what constituted a proper letter of apology and request for restitution for Astandalan aristocrats.","My lord Cavalier:\nI am sorry to say that I misconstrued your comments, the last time we spoke at court. I hope you will accept my regret for my untoward response. Will you permit me to take you out for a meal that I may make my apologies in person?\nYour servant,\nCliopher s.

If you provide me with a range of suitable dates, I shall make the arrangements.\n—C. an Vilius","The thing which Conju knew, and which had somehow so far escaped the notice of the court, was that his Radiancy was steadfast.","He’d decided, hadn’t he? That the secretary was worth cultivating?—and worth being seen with?—and truthfully, he wasn’t decorative, not the way Conju liked his men, but he was so vivacious Conju could overlook that.","Conju considered that (he was now certain) carefully chosen blue-black ink.","Really, no one should be surprised.

I have been adored as a god, but am now returned to the mortal lands on a quest of great moment.”\nEvery word of this, I swear, was the honest truth.","Down, and down, the slope gentler now, speed a little moderated but still fast enough that the air seemed cool against my face, and I realized I was laughing madly, whooping with delight, the air echoing with it.\nBy all the gods, how I’d missed this!","I am certainly no longer a young man off to seek my fortune, nevertheless the task of finding who you truly are and where you truly belong never ends.","And of course, recently escaped prisoners of state generally ought not to linger in the environs.","My splendid independence lasted only until full dark, when I missed a turn and toppled straight into a fen.\nFortunately some passing arsonists found this amusing and rescued me.","It is a hazard of the profession, arrogance.

On the one hand, this was not true. On the other, what a delicious mistake.","Sometimes I hate how Kip is always right.","While I have encountered dragons, sea serpents, monstrous lizards, and any number of large snakes—what sort of magic-wielding folk hero hasn’t?—giant intelligent serpents from the dawn of time were new to me.","The Tigara was one of the Ancients of Days, and it tasted of the Wild.","I have never quite figured out just what it is about me that makes people think I’m a trickster god.","I have never felt it a good idea to pretend to a divinity not mine. Presumptuous I may be in many ways, but even I do not go that far.","I was glad withal it was myself lighting the fire, for I could ensure it did not destroy those bindings as it burned down the rest. I hoped Kip would appreciate the restraint when he realized it was me.","I wished I had put back on my scarlet silk mantle but it really wasn’t—\nOh, the hell with prudence.","It’s not as if I were actually going to perform magic by means of music—though I have met a few practitioners of that and related arts—more that I was going to accompany my magic-working with music. For the effect, I suppose you could say.","The fire rose and my voice lifted and the darkness and the silence of the Fens broke open like a thunderbolt striking a forest into flame.","“Come inexplicably, do something wild and joyous and strange, and leave even more inexplicably, with only a song and the world upended to show you’ve passed by.”\nI could not help but be wholly delighted with being given this reputation, whether or not it was in fact mine.","I felt I made a very satisfying picture: a tall black-skinned man, regal of bearing, with the white tunic, and the scarlet silk mantle, and a golden harp in his hands, all against the backdrop of the black water and the rising smoke and the silvery-grey dawn.","Perhaps it is to his idea of how much time things ought to take that the Palace clock runs. He may not be a wizard of any form but his mind shapes the world even so.","Of course I could work with things like sails or artificial wings or gliders; but that’s not flying.

There was a period when I was fond of sonnets.","I clambered up and down the tree until I determined that it would be foolhardy in the extreme to try to jump to another. Foolish I can certainly be, and foolhardy too, but as I had neither cause nor audience I was able to resist the temptation.","It was quite amazing how hard it was to be on my own. I had not thought myself so dependent on company, when I yearned for solitude and privacy.","“I was praying to the emperor,” she said earnestly.\nThis is the problem with an official state religion. I’m not a very effective deity, I’m afraid. But what could I do but try?","Three days after leaving the Palace and here I was, already halfway across a different continent having adventures and assisting maidens in distress. It was all most satisfactory.","I thought back to the many, many conversations I’d had with Kip on the subject, and the nine-hundred-page Plan I’d dutifully read.","“Should I ask who you are, sir?”\n“Probably not. I promise you by the Sun and the Moon and the One Above that I mean only good to those who have asked my assistance.”\nThat was a binding oath; but it was not the first I have made to my people.","And after that—well, who knew? Something would happen. It always did.","I should perhaps state that I don’t actually like everyone on sight, but most people are so intriguing it is hard not to find them appealing.","Perhaps it’s just that I meet very interesting people.\nI’m sure that’s it. Nothing to do with most of a lifetime kept rigidly and rigorously apart from any normal interactions.","“It’s not me you should thank,” I replied, thinking of how hard Kip had worked to make this a reality. I had done so little besides encourage him. (And read his nine-hundred-page Plan.)","“Let me tell you what I see, sir: a man who has fulfilled every one of society’s expectations for him. He has left his position, very recently I would guess, and is now looking to find out who he truly is.”","Kip had arranged such papers as I might need under a not-quite-false name, but I wasn’t sure if he would have thought of this. I began to write Tor, but the ink did not flow.\nIt made me, I confess, inordinately pleased that Kip had missed that one small detail.","I hesitated, but if it did accept Fitzroy Angursell ...?\nAnd if it didn’t?\nTo my shame, I was not brave enough to test the magic.","The Postal Plan was only three hundred and twenty pages, but I had read that, too. The things I do for my people!","There was a lengthy period of time in which I used my spare hours in a hobby of learning spells of unlocking (for no particular reason, I assure you; except possibly something at a deep metaphorical level that I certainly never once thought of).","Forge us swords out of starlight, Masseo, so we will be able to cut through the shadows.\nWill you make us a goblet that can hold the truth?\nWill you make an axe strong enough and sharp enough for Pharia to cut down a mountain?\nWill you make a lock that only we could ever open?","“I’ve an adventure in hand which I think you would be most excellently well suited for, Master Smith.”","Masseo grunted, the sound so doubly familiar that I nearly started.—Who else sounded just like that?","“Come in,” he said, beckoning me back through the door and once more into the kitchen. “Have another cup of tea, and a cake, and tell me a lie to explain away Marilda’s theory that you’re Aurelius Magnus returned.”","“Look at me.”\nI did, recalling once again as I did how for almost that entire thousand years the only person who ever met my eyes was Kip. (How he and Masseo would like each other! Oh, so I hoped so dearly!)","“Fitzroy, you came into my life like the incarnation of chaos and I always expected that one day you would leave it as precipitously and as much in a jumble. Between those two moments my life changed—I changed—so much and so much for the better. Never apologize for being who you are!”","“A curse laid on my family came upon me, and I rode my horse across three worlds until it caught me and held me and bound me in its inexorable requirements, and I spent the rest of my life until three days ago under the heaviest guard in the Empire of Astandalas.”","There was one high window in my private study, too high to look out of unless I climbed up onto a table and thence onto a chair I’d put on the table. From there I could lean my arms on the narrow sill and see a wedge of sky.","“Why do you have a spare anvil?” I’d asked in my innocence.\nHe regarded me as if my mind had gone wandering. “For when you came back, of course.”","I had dreamed of what was afflicting my people during those years, when I was in that enchanted sleep. I had walked in shadows and fear, lost and alone, looking always for my friends of the Red Company.","I set my shoulders and myself for an audience, smiling like a fabled enchanter of old, like Fitzroy Angursell on a quest, like a merry-making Trickster come to earth; and I could not pretend I did not enjoy myself better for the pretence.","All people are interesting, if you find out what they are particularly interested in.","I felt as if we had entered an enchanted moment, and could not bear to break it with words of loneliness and sorrow and questions about what had passed between then and now.","“I am Saavelor Zunidh, and I have no need to conquer. You are my people, long hidden though you have been, and I will do all I must to see you thrive.”","“Mae Irión is the Last Free City of Zunidh, who never was conquered: hear ye all that she shall remain free, and rise again.”","“What?” I asked, a little sharply.\n“Oh, nothing,” he said, smiling, as he came up beside me. “I was merely reflecting on how well you hide your majesty, most of the time.”","The curse challenged, received my response, and slithered away to investigate a bright forge-fire coming near me. He is under my protection, I said without words, enclosing Masseo within my magic, safe and secure as an ember tucked into a bed of coals.","I leaned over to pick the mirror up. As soon as my hand touched the handle the whole thing dissolved into a pile of dust.\n“I hope you didn’t have a strong need to unlock any hearts with that,” Masseo said after a moment.\n“It was only mine,” I replied lightly.","Masseo watched me write for a while until he pulled out a small knife and a block of wood and began to whittle. His expression reminded me a great deal of Ludvic Omo, the commander of my guards, who was a stolid man of few words and great hidden poetry. He, too, whittled.","It would be nice, I reflected, to have my own place, not a palace but a home.","I confess I cheated.\nWhatever dangers there might be in the unexplored jungle that had swallowed up half the river-basin, and I was certain there were many, nothing was likely to challenge a great mage in the course of his work.\nAs I said, cheating. That is not the way to have an adventure.","“You’re so calm and collected now.”\nSerene, my inner, sarcastic voice commented. I could have said it aloud: there were no guards or servants or courtiers here, just a dear friend. But my tongue would not move. His hilarity and disbelief at discovering me an emperor of Astandalas was too fresh.","“I suppose,” Masseo went on thoughtfully, “that I had always felt that being part of the Red Company was a gift—a reprieve—it never seemed quite real, though it was also the most real part of my life.”","“I am from Zunidh,” he said into the quiet. “The Azilint. It doesn’t matter where exactly.”\nHis voice made it clear it did matter, and also that he wasn’t going to tell me.","I felt the magic pause, listening. I would have been worried if I had not known Masseo for ten years, and seen him in his village more recently, for wakeful magic judges, and answers like to like. What door opened for us at dawn would be a response to this midnight confession.","“If she turned me in to the authorities, so be it. I would go up before the Lord Emperor with my head high, if that was what she decided.”\nHe had never come up before me; I had never had that test.","I wanted to sink my hands into that fur, feel the great cat’s heart beating against my skin. Nothing I had ever encountered before—not even the great bronze bells made out of the hammers of Aurdar—had ever felt so deeply and incontestably Zunidh.","“Young Mr. Greenwing here slew the dragon—with a bread knife, I understood?”\n“A cake knife,” the young man muttered.\n“The details are critical,” I agreed solemnly.","“There’s a bookstore in town that I think you would very much like to see, sir. It’s called Elderflower Books—”","I liked Ragnor Bella immediately, though I probably would have gone mad in short order had I been obliged to live there.","“In the past week alone I have been taken for Yr the Conqueror, his father Harbut Zalarin, Aurelius Magnus, and Artorin Damara.”","“No, husband of mine: your mother is dead and so is mine, and so with an apology to my sister—I,” she declared proudly, “am Jullanar of the Sea.”","“Fitzroy Angursell!”\nI bowed (not something I was well practiced in) as the crowd murmured. “In the flesh.”\n“Where,” she demanded, “have you been?”","“I was caught by a dire curse laid upon my family, enchanted, entrammelled, enslaved, and finally was only able to escape because one of my guards took pity on me and the Moon woke my slumbering heart.”\n“Do you know,” said Jullanar with vast sarcasm, “that makes perfect sense.”","“You, sir, are a fool. You will be fortunate indeed to be only a footnote in history. No—no. Do not speak. Every word you say is fuel to my fire; if Jullanar only speaks the word, I can ensure that you are a laughingstock on three worlds.”","“I am Fitzroy Angursell of the Red Company: poet, revolutionary, magus, fool. My poetry was banned on five worlds for being too excellent, and moving people’s souls too greatly.”","“This is Masseo Umrit, whose hands wrought legends, weapons fit for the gods and those who would assail the gods, as we did in the Holy Desert of Kaph, when we championed the Wind Lords against their enemies.”","“Jullanar of the Sea, who sparked the revolution of Galderon, who taught Astandalas what it meant to be true to one’s soul, who was courted by three fairy princes and the sea-king of the North, who held up her very ordinariness up as a banner to fly before our glory.”","“Criminals? If you insist. Rather more people would call us folk heroes.”","I resolutely did not worry about the far higher likelihood of a portraitist correctly identifying me.","Jullanar now looked at me. “I’m ready,” she said, “to be Jullanar of the Sea again.”","“Oh, don’t be absurd, Fitzroy,” Jullanar said. “Your advice on questing is always the same: decide on your object and then go look for something else entirely.”\n“There are refinements,” I said with dignity.","“Mr. Greenwing, are you interested in business ownership?”","I wondered what might be necessary to turn the stick into a proper wizard’s staff.\nNot—as you will have gathered—that I am in any way a proper wizard, but sometimes one wishes to convey a certain image.","I closed my eyes against tears that surely would never fall. But I had not held anyone since we had last met; and Jullanar had been the first one ever to embrace me, many years ago now as it was.","He’d bought them for Jullanar, whose favourite fruit they were and who had had a difficult morning. I was greatly touched that she was willing to share them with me.","It made me acutely aware of just how few conversations I’d had.\nI spoke: and was obeyed.","I was afraid of ruining the conversation. Surely I was unconsciously, unconscionably arrogant, accustomed as I was to instant obedience, instant service, instant deference.","I spread out a length of cloth that had come out of my private study and wished I hadn’t had the thought, for now the place reminded me of that small room, burrowed deep in the heart of the Palace where I could be considered safe.","Jullanar stopped laughing and said, “Are we—I’m sorry, did I hurt your feelings?”\n“It’s nothing. I’m ... unaccustomed to ... teasing.”\n“Oh, no.” Her face went aghast. Masseo, when I looked at him, appeared almost as distraught.","“By the all gods,” Jullanar said crossly, “and that includes you, Fitzroy, sit down and let’s talk this out like the adults we are.”","“Do people talk out their emotions, in your experience?”\nShe raised her eyebrows at me. “Don’t they in yours?”","“Fitzroy,” he said slowly and seriously, “have you ever told someone what you were truly thinking?”\nI could have said something flippant, but I was tired, and spoke a hard truth instead. “Masseo, people have committed suicide because I told them what I actually thought.”","I was, I had been told once, an institution, and institutions did not have feelings.","It was true that I had become friends with Kip after he and I had had several conversations in which we told each other true things about our emotions, even if both of us retreated quickly thereafter to easier topics, like world governance and the eradication of poverty.","If she had been any member of my household, my posture and expression would have told her in no uncertain terms to back off immediately.\nBecause they were (had been?) my friends, they paid no attention whatsoever to my demeanour, and persisted.","Jullanar kept speaking but I heard only the voice in my mind saying, in my coldest and harshest imperial tone, Does she not know that we are the Emperor of Astandalas?","I set things on fire when my emotions were roused beyond control; I did not make storms.\nYet when I had tried, and nearly failed, to make my household see that I was a man, and not merely a god, it was a tempest I had called up, a wall of rain and a storm of winds.","Why did this hurt so? I had spent so long wishing to be treated as a person, a friend, a human being.","I’d been known to get much more thoroughly lost on slighter grounds. (Though in my defence: the universe is full of invitations, some of which are irresistible.)","I wanted to be only Fitzroy Angursell—oh, how badly!—but if the last three days in Masseo’s and now Jullanar’s company had shown me anything, it was that I could not quite help but wish to be Artorin Damara as well.","I might in truth have been a good emperor only in comparison to my uncle Eritanyr but I had tried, dammit, and I was tired of pretending otherwise.","“I was trying,” I said, and added, ruefully, “I’m sure I’m doing a poor job of it. Being ... ordinary.”\nThe shepherdess puffed at her pipe. “Can’t say as any of the songs or stories ever made Fitzroy Angursell out to be that.”","“Masseo, please! I listened to you when you spoke the truth of your past—will you not extend me the same courtesy? Why is my heart a laughing-matter?” ","“I am the present Lord Magus of Zunidh, High King of Rondé and yes, Prince of the White Forest. And yes, I am Fitzroy Angursell of the Red Company, whom no one ever believes when he speaks the truth.”","For so long it had been Kip and Kip alone, who had done more than he could possibly realize to keep me sane.","“Is this—are you actually wearing the Imperial Seal?”\nI raised my eyebrows at her, grateful beyond measure to move on from all that emoting. “No one else should be.”","A week ago I had spent half an hour nervously asking Kip how to greet people. He had sensibly suggested that hugs were not usual between strangers, and thus not to worry if I felt awkward about them.\nDespite my heart’s excitement, I found I liked them just as much as I remembered.","With mischief in her eyes Jullanar made a traditional grace to the gods and the Lord Emperor. \nI replied with the appropriate short benediction, because I might be a very indifferent god but I do know my duty.","We had just spent that excruciating period talking about feelings like adults (even if like no other adults I had ever spent any time with or observed).","“Dear Lady,” Jullanar said in a hollow voice. “We broke your heart.”","Masseo reached out to poke at one of the shards with his finger. I felt a strange twist in my heart and nearly lost track of the conversation.\n“Please don't do that,” I murmured.\nHe removed his hand with a startled oath.","That my heart could be so fragile as that, to shatter with the lightest tap, did not surprise me at all.","I scooped up the diamond shards with my both my hands, and the fire burned and the diamonds cut but I knew what I had to do, for I am a wild mage and my heart sings when the deed is right and the time is now.","I held the burning diamonds in my cupped hands until my hands caught fire, and then I endured the pain as whatever it was I had given up burned itself back into me.","That night I dreamed I was flying.","The Empire fell upon me like a tsunami and plunged me so deep under its waters that it took me a thousand years to resurface.","“Somehow,” she said, “I wasn’t expecting to be related to a crow.”","I stepped back, stumbled as my legs did not work as I thought they should, flung out my arms to catch my balance, and a gust of wind caught me and I was aloft.\nIt was even better than my dream, for this was real.","“My thirteen year-old-self was an utter idiot.”","“Pali, I’m not sure if you’ve ever noticed this before, but I am not a very typical member of my family.”","“You are magnificent,” I said, and then, looking her straight in the eyes, “We should get married.”","She said, “Oh, you’re impossible!” and took my arm to pull me inside.\nI followed, laughing.

Certainly it has never been attributed to him.”","Another woman stood on the other side, equally startled by the unexpectedly open door, as familiar as Pali’s own reflection.\n“Jullanar!” said Pali.\nAnd—“Pali!” said Jullanar of the Sea, falling into her arms. “Oh, Pali!”","Oh, it was Jullanar. Pali did not feel the shock of their first meeting, but an upwelling, an overflowing—a brimming of happiness.","“Oh yes, Mr. Dart was my student—I teach at Stoneybridge,” Pali explained.\nMr. Greenwing gaped at her before catching himself again. “You’re Domina Black?","He had been magnificent already, to tell the truth, but she had met gods before, and knew they asked for things mortals did not always know they gave.","Few moments in Pali’s life had ever been so fated as that first encounter with Jullanar, with Fitzroy, with Damian. It was no exaggeration to say the entire course of the Nine Worlds had shifted because of that meeting.","Pali was not her sister Sardeet, stolen away by the Blue Wind to become his bride.\nPali was the one who had widowed her.","She had always chosen adventure, when the world held out its invitations.\nBut she would not succumb to some mischievous god, some trickster come mumming a human being.","He had only laughed, joy in his eyes, in his voice, in his whole being. And Pali had known, as she had always known such things, that she was as caught by his look, his laugh, his rich voice, as her sister Sardeet had been by the Blue Wind.","“I cannot offer you such a challenge to your skill myself, but I can offer you an invitation to a great adventure.”\n“What adventure?” Pali had asked, suspicious but also intrigued.\n“We three seek to stop an invading army,” Jullanar had stated baldly. “Will you help us?”","“I followed his trail, the stories of the horse running through the sky, the black-skinned wizard in sky-blue and scarlet, the magic foaming about him.”","“Why cannot we let him go?”\n“We must,” said Pali, who had ruthlessly rooted out thoughts of Fitzroy Angursell until they came no more than once or twice a week.","“Are you married?”\nPali stared at her. “No, of course not.”\nJullanar flushed, then grinned. “I suppose not. There was always—”\n“We’re not talking about him,” Pali interrupted sharply. Though of course that only emphasized the direction her thoughts had taken","There were probably a thousand things she should be asking Jullanar, but—oh, there was something so immensely precious at simply being able to sit with her.","Jullanar bit her lip, her eyes bright. “The Dark Kings ran away from you?”\n“It was all most unsatisfactory.”\n“I expect it would be.”","Pali met her friend’s mirthful look and could not keep her own countenance. They laughed, peals of laughter, as if they were young women discovering friendship for the first time.","“Now,” Pali said seriously once they had stopped laughing. “About this husband of yours. Do I need to kill him?”","“So long as you know I am ready for any assistance you might need,” Pali said solemnly.\n“Far beyond the hiding of a body?”\n“Pish-tush. That’s an amateur’s concern.”\nJullanar stared at her. “Pali Avramapul, did you just say pish-tush?”","“Ivy Black?” Jullanar laughed merrily. “However did you choose that? Did you look out the window and see ivy leaves and—you did, didn’t you?”","They could not possibly be written by Fitzroy Angursell, for though the poet’s mastery was incontestable, he would never been so vague and elliptical, so vertiginously blurring the images. So ... sad.","It was good to be with Jullanar again. Pali had not thought herself lonely, but oh, she had been. How she had been.","“We shall have to find a ship able to take us into the Sea of Stars,” Jullanar said finally.\nSo they could go look for Fitzroy. Pali nodded, and Jullanar slung her arm about her shoulders, comfortingly snug. “Pali, it’s no shame to miss him particularly.”","“Have you ever been interested in someone else?”\nPali did scoff at that. “Of course not.”\n“He was different, then.”\nPali looked back at her friend, whose expression was thoughtful in the dim light cast by the fairy-lights.\n“I suppose so,” she said carelessly. “He always was, wasn’t he?”","“Oh, my cousin Kip would have liked you,” Basil said, admiration sliding into his expression.","The idea, the very sound of the words, of ‘going to sit at the feet of the Sun’, was epic poetry in her heart.","“I looked around this room, which was full of people, all sorts of people, and I felt as if I had stepped right into the Lays, and so I knew.”\nPali had stepped into legends once or twice, and she did know.","I doubt he ever initiated a courtship in his life, but the first time he saw a portrait of the Emperor Artorin he actually said ‘our fates are entwined.’","Pali registered a certain kinship to this Kip, who did not have much interest in sex and who understood the call of Fate.","Pali could not help but contrast them with Professor Vane, who would almost certainly have been as enthusiastic about Pali’s home culture as Jullanar was about Basil’s. But Pali was not Jullanar, and had never known how to step out of her own reserve.","It was a sad thought that she might have had so much more, had she ever crossed the mountains into South Fiellan.","“You’ll have to go back to Stoneybridge, I expect—unless of course you wish to make a grand and mysterious disappearance.”\n“It’s tempting, but I would like my own horse.”","Pali very carefully reminded herself that she was Pali Avramapul of the Red Company, and she was not to be awestruck so easily. No doubt she was feeling slightly under the weather from a cold she’d picked up on the stagecoach.","Someone in this government cared deeply for the Archives, and funded them accordingly.","Back in Astandalan days people had always spoken almost familiarly of ‘Emperor Artorin’, but that custom had been replaced by his titles and especially that reverent Lord Emperor.","The greatest difference was that not one person, from the page to the Chief Librarian to the Undersecretary in Chief of the Offices of the Lords of State, had shown any inclination to being bribed.","Pali was not easily intimidated, but by the time she had come to the seventh antechamber, and the seventh set of guards, she could count herself ... impressed. It was all very irritating.","Pali considered him and decided that they were real guards. She could have taken one of them, even without any long weapon of her own, but she was sufficiently out of practice she wouldn’t have wanted to assume she could take both out easily.","She was not Pali Avramapul of the Red Company here, or Paliammë-ivanar of the Oclaresh; she was the respected and respectable scholar Domina Black, professor of Stoneybridge.","It was clear enough he was staring directly at her, completely shocked.\nFuck, she thought. He’d recognized her.","The stone stairs and floors of St Erlingale’s old monastic cloister were worn from the steps of many monks over many centuries. How much had the Lord Emperor paced to wear down the stone like that?","She remembered another man, equally tall and black-skinned, with eyes like an eagle’s, and could only think that this man, emperor of five worlds as he had been, was nothing compared to Fitzroy Angursell of the Red Company.","She could, she supposed, break that superlative vase and use the shards as a weapon.\nNo. She could not do that. It was too beautiful a piece of art.\nIf she were to be taken for being Pali Avramapul, she would be taken with her head high and her eyes unafraid.","There were sixteen armed men between here and the door to the Palace proper. She had a penknife in her pocket and her wit and her words. And he was only the Last Emperor of Astandalas, after all.","What sort of file did he have on her, to know how she took her tea?","“What,” she said, “no marriage proposal?”\nHis expression didn’t change, although his eyes sharpened, lightened, magic kindling in them.\n“It seemed presumptuous,” he said.\n“I thought that was the nature of the game,” she replied, still trying to gather her thoughts together.","Pali watched him gather himself, her ears ringing with that habitual pronoun. She felt blank, fury a white wind in her mind, like a sandstorm about to swallow her up. How was this the man she had once loved?","This hard glittering carapace was not her friend, was not ever her friend, could not be the picture she took away with her. She wouldn’t let it be.","Once she had walked through a burning forest to reach the pain-maddened Fitzroy at its centre, daring the living fire of his induced madness to harm her.","“I am still me,” he said, whispered really, so quietly it was nearly lost in the wind.","Fifteen years of scholarship and twenty years of doubtful wondering answered in one unexpected encounter.\nFifteen years of scholarship, and she had never seen—\nShe would have to redo all of her monograph.","She was conscious mostly of a sovereign disappointment: in herself, in Fitzroy, in Artorin Damara, in herself as a scholar, in herself as a friend, in herself as his friend.","“We are not here in any official capacity, Domina. We are here on behalf of our lord.”\nPali was sure she must be imagining the feather-light touch of warmth in his voice as he said lord.","It was these men—not simply men like these, but these men in particular—who kept him hemmed into his place, that rootless star fixed and dimmed, diminished.","She was not able to be anything but ironic, detached, for else she would fly at him with every weapon she had, that he should be so urbane and intelligent and admired and yet hold Fitzroy there, shut that star into some thieves’ lantern of a cell.","She knew Fitzroy would not choose a fool. She knew that.\nIt made it all the more harder that he would choose such a brilliant jailer for himself.","She let them go, the Lord Chancellor and the Commander of the Imperial Guard. She did not draw her dagger on them. Not yet. Not yet.","She had learned patience. Once Fitzroy was free would be the time to catalogue the grievances and exact her vengeance.\nLet Fitzroy’s jailer have this bout. She would not underestimate him next time.","A kidnapping first, and then vengeance. That was the proper order of such things.","“I expect you will be hearing more of the Red Company soon,” Pali said, halfway between a threat and a promise.","He always was different, Fitzroy.\nHer reasonable mind said that of course he was: he had been more vibrant, more lively, more mischievous, more splendid, than anyone else.\nBut that wasn’t what Jullanar had meant, and not, perhaps, what Pali meant either.\nFor Fitzroy had been different, for her.","No one else had that high chivalry, that courage so nonchalant it could not even be called reckless, for he had not even seemed to understand that there might be such a thing as danger, or if there were that it could ever apply to him.","Pali thought over what he had said, what she had said, and what she could tell Jullanar of the encounter, and found herself more and more ... guilty.\nShe did not like feeling guilty, and she did not like that she had a day’s walk to the garrison to dwell on her emotions.","He, Fitzroy that is, had a household.\nThe Commander of the Imperial Guard was, for some reason, a part of it.\nWhat did household mean, for the emperor—former emperor—in his palace?","She could not imagine returning to Stoneybridge, teaching the history of the latter days of Astandalas, writing papers and monographs, about him.\nIt was impossible. She could not even begin to countenance the idea.","“Professor Black—” she stopped, took several uneven breaths, and then: “Pali Avramapul?”\n“Yes,” she said, as if this was not still treasonous, not still astonishing. Not a surprise. Not a leap into a level of friendship she had never let herself make.","“I have offered you water, and salt, and bread, and wine, according to the customs of my people,” she said. “These are offerings of hospitality: under my roof you are my guest, sacred to the gods.”","Professor Vane took the painting and stared down at it. “I don’t understand. This is Artorin Damara.”\n“That,” said Pali, staring at the fireplace, “is Fitzroy Angursell.”","“Elena,” Pali said intently, leaning forward to match her friend’s anxious posture, “I’m the same person who’s been passing notes with you in faculty meetings for the last five years.”\n“But I didn’t know you were Pali Avramapul then.”","Jullanar had been similarly afflicted with bouts of tears. They had never stopped Jullanar from achieving anything she wished to accomplish.","She had blurted out the truth to Elena, and Elena had responded well. Pali could feel their friendship building, like a wind piling up a dune, grain by grain.","She still was rather bitter about some aspects of that journey to the Moon’s country, all in all. Fitzroy hadn’t needed to flaunt himself like that, surely.","“The rumour is that you had a youthful career as an imperial spy.”\nNow, that was a pleasing idea.“It was quite the opposite, and therefore not so different at all.”","Fitzroy always liked to be close, was forever touching. Pali had grown used to it, to his shoulder against hers, his hand in her hair, his chin coming over the crown of her head and his arms enfolding her shoulders.","She had been procrastinating a touch, perhaps, unwilling to go to Jullanar without any plan beyond “Fitzroy is actually Artorin Damara, yes, really, the Last Emperor—yes, really—and we must go kidnap him away from his guards and bureaucrats. Especially his bureaucrats.”","Every time Pali thought of the Lord Chancellor’s smug face she wanted to punch the daylights out of him. She had dreamed a most satisfying dream of pummelling him, while Fitzroy watched.","She kept repeating her plan to herself. Collect Jullanar. Return to Zunidh. Rescue Fitzroy. Then vengeance.","“I could have wished for my friends, to find them ... but wishes are dangerous, Elena. One must be careful they do not come too true. But the possibility of a wish, now, that is a fine and splendid thing.”","Pali knew that as soon as the rumours started, which they surely already had, they would become a great cascading series of explosions, fireworks touching off each other in a night sky.","What an extraordinary gift it was, she mused at one point as she looked at the rapt interest of her audience, that there were still new adventures to be had.","Pali would never admit it, but she’d always liked roosters: they reminded her of Fitzroy.","Pali had smiled at her, and Jullanar smiled back, and if Pali had not held her sword in her hand—\nShe had never fallen into a stranger’s arms, caught by their smile. That was the only time she had ever felt the desire.","It could be Jullanar already, if her friend had made good of her plan and indeed left Ragnor Bella immediately.\nHer heart leapt at the thought.\nI can offer you an invitation to a great adventure.\nAnd they were not finished yet.","Should she be ferociously enraged she did not need to storm the Palace of Stars to rescue him?","She felt a disquieting sense of ... unbalance. Disequilibrium. For the first time she wondered how he would have reacted if she had come to rescue him.","As the Lord Emperor of Zunidh after the Fall, he was great. She refused to believe it was all his Lord Chancellor’s work.","“Does our Fitzroy have a very dear friend who is a Wide Seas Islander, do you know?”","Pali’s thoughts flashed to that unassuming man with the brilliant wit who had come down to see her and convinced her that Fitzroy Angursell was best left in his cage.","They might have been three students on the steps of a campus building, she thought, smiling at the idea of the three of them—the four of them—the ten of them—as students raising havoc.","“You don’t think he prefers being bald, do you?”\n“Why, Pali, do you have a preference?” Jullanar asked, her voice bright with amusement.\n“I—no, of course not, he has a very regal skull,” she stammered.","“Why is my heart a laughing-matter?”\nPali stared at him, all the amusement draining out of her.\nWhy is my heart a laughing-matter?\nHad she ever truly believed he had a human heart?\nHad she ever truly granted him sincerity?","How could he sit there before them, every inch the last emperor of Astandalas, every inch Fitzroy Angursell, and begin to forgive her?\nHe forgave her even unto giving her a hug when she went up to him, not sure what she dared to ask.","She had always thought being embraced by him was ... Nice.\nShe had never given it another name. Nice. It was nice.","His magic moved and flexed in the air around him, around them, no weight on her but sizzling with the possibilities of—\nWell. The possibilities. He was a great and wild mage. The possibilities were endless.","One of the things that she had always loved was sparring.\nAnd sparring verbally with Fitzroy had always been one of her very favourite things.","“It has just occurred to me,” Jullanar said, her voice suddenly brightening, “that we are on an adventure and we—we need merely accept the invitation held out to us.”","“It has been a long time since I was last outside the ... former Empire,” he said, moving his hand in the air. Faint gold sparkles gathered around his fingers, trailing briefly in the air behind him, as if he were smudging light behind him. “I had forgotten how ... freeing it is.”","He had started from so uncertain a footing—unknown, without allies, ignorant of most of the factions of the court—but his innate brilliance and skill at understanding people had meant that within fourteen years he had been superb.","“What are you writing?” Jullanar asked, after they had sat in companionable quiet for a time. \n“A letter,” he said simply.\n“A long letter,” Jullanar responded, her voice light. “Who is it for?”\nFitzroy looked down at the sheets beside him, which he’d weighted down with a stone. “A ... friend.”","“There,” Jullanar crooned. “You’re awake now.” Fitzroy smiled at her; his voice was distant, sleepy.\n“I can’t be. People only hold me in my dreams.”","“It is strange that there is not more fog. Usually I cannot see you at all. But then this is a dream.”\n“It’s not a dream,” Jullanar tried again.\n“You’re touching me,” he said simply, as if this were indisputable proof.","“And here you are ... you and Masseo and Pali ...”\n“Yes. We’re here, Fitzroy.”\n“Holding me, and my name. Will it be worse in the morning to have dreamed this, I wonder?”","“I started making decisions based on what I thought you would say.”\nJullanar spluttered out a disbelieving laugh. “You didn’t!”\n“I did,” he affirmed, satisfied. “You keep my heart safe ... I thought you could keep my people safe too ...”","“Will you hold me until I must wake?”\n“Of course, Fitzroy. We’ll keep the fire safe.”\n“Never ... doubted ...”","“Do I look particularly fetching this morning?” Fitzroy asked, his mouth quirking up into a smile. “I think this gives a nice line to my legs, don’t you?”\nPali blushed and averted her eyes.","He had filled out over the years, and though there was a softness overlaying his muscles, his figure was ... fine. It was fine.\nNo doubt it was the perfectly fitted clothes. He probably had a staff of exceptionally talented tailors. And cobblers.","“You have good tailors,” she said, lifting her chin, meeting his gaze with a stubborn refusal to be embarrassed that she had been caught admiring his legs, the smooth line of his back.","“I’m finding the freedom of choosing—any colour! any cut! Anything I want at all!—hair-raisingly extravagant.”","Pali listened with interest for a few minutes, until she remembered she despised the Lord Chancellor and had sworn vengeance on him.","“Elena’s very keen on rambling. It was quite the thing to do.”\nJullanar was regarding her with a sparkling amusement.\n“What?” Pali asked defensively.\n“That sounds so ... relaxing,” Jullanar said. “It doesn’t involve any stabbing at all?”","Fitzroy, alas, was still talking about his bloody viceroy.","“There was some stabbing,” she made sure to add to Jullanar, at one point. “I did practice.”\n“Well,” Jullanar said after dutifully considering this, fighting valiantly not to laugh out loud, “I would hate for you to drop such a useful hobby.”","Fitzroy regarded the ghostly boat, his expression fascinated, before he shook his head. “The world is full of invitations. We can leave that one for someone else.”\nAnd so they did.","“It’s wonderful to wear things that are not insanely delicate. Look at this, it’s what? Wool?” He tugged at the hem, turning it up so she could see the fabric. “No silk, no lace, no gold embroidery, no jewels, no ahalo cloth, no plaques of gold ... It’s so practical.”","Fitzroy was two weeks out of the Palace. He was tentative and hesitant about certain activities and behaviours that were, apparently, foreign to his experience there; but he was still Fitzroy, the quicksilver mind and great spirit unquenched by his learned serenity.","She was walking with one of the greatest magic-workers in the Nine Worlds. She was Pali Avramapul of the Red Company. They would be fine.","“I don’t get to make those choices, Pali. I don’t get to decide what topics are too personal. No, Pali. You see, when you are the head of state the assumption is that there is no privacy. No topic is taboo. If I refuse to speak about something, that is the act of a tyrant.”","“I tried. I tried so hard. And it made no difference. Eventually I ... I gave up. Is that what you wanted to hear? I am not perfect, Pali, I am not divine, I am a human being and I. Gave. Up.”","“I was a river,” he said after a terrible silence. “Dammed against my will into a lake. I could not break the confines of my dam, and so ... and so I reconciled myself to being a lake. Eventually I learned how to be still.”","“If, now that you have taken exhaustive inventory of what’s left of me beyond the emperor, you are displeased by what remains, you need not feel obliged to continue to condescend to associate with me.”","He was not the enemy, Pali reminded herself.\nThat guard, that bureaucrat, the whole fucking structure of Astandalas—she breathed in through her nose.\nHe was not the enemy. He was her second-best-friend. Her whole being was roiled and she would have given a great deal to have a true enemy to fight.","She was startled by the twinge she felt thinking about her life in Stoneybridge. She had not thought there was so much she would miss.","Fitzroy gave her one of his sunny smiles, one of the ones that always made Pali think he was performing himself.","Pali, looking at his still face, remembered the rumours she had heard on Zunidh that it had been a thousand years since the Fall for the Palace folk.\nA thousand years was long enough to wear a line into the floor. What would it do to your heart? Your spirit?","Pali hesitated, then took the seat next to him, rather than one of those opposite. She wanted the wall behind her, that was all.\nWhen they were younger, before, she might have nudged Fitzroy’s knee with her own.","“I’m sorry,” he said abruptly. “I would offer the hospitality of our house—I do offer—but—no. I must ask you. How could you be a wild mage—inside—inside—the empire?”","“Are you, by any chance, Terec of Lund?”","“Conju is very dear to me,” Fitzroy said, plainly, “and I owe it to him, if not to you, to tell you the full truth.”","“I could not touch my magic as the emperor. I could not feel it, save for the terrible knowledge of its lack.”\n“Not at all?” Terec asked.\n“Not at all,”\n“How did you live?” Terec whispered.\n“I fulfilled the duties laid before me, as honourably as I could.”","She recalled, as if from a dream, that one of the forms of torture the ancient emperor had decried was Preventing a mage from accessing his magic.\nAurelius Magnus had declared that unlawful. Torture.","Pali looked hard at the illusory man, committing his features to memory, holding to Fitzroy’s view of him, for he would surely become part of her life, this man whom Fitzroy held dear enough to tell two perfect strangers the deep secrets he had not yet been able to share with his own friends.","She was hugging to herself the idea that someone actually disliked Fitzroy’s poetry for all the right reasons.\nAnd for it to be his—the Lord Emperor’s—chief attendant, the head of his domestic household—oh, what a gift!","“I have made it a kind of ... talisman, or ... perhaps compass is the better word. It will not guide you north, but to Conju.”","“You should have the bed,” Fitzroy said, too swiftly for Pali’s liking.\n“I’m sure I couldn’t ask your Radiancy to condescend so far as the floor,” Pali returned.","She did not want to know what he intended for the future, what image he had for what could come after his quest was completed, his reign definitively ended. What did he expect his household to do?\nWhat place, she dared not ask, did he imagine for the Red Company?","Fitzroy had waited in the central, obvious place, his image on every new coin, for a rendezvous and rescue that had never come.","She shouldn’t be staring at Fitzroy, at his quiet face and his perfect posture and all the performance of himself.","“You look a little out-of-sorts,” Jullanar said, smiling at her with nothing in her expression but gentle encouragement. “I’m sure you’ll feel better if you fence for a bit.”\nIt was a strange thing, to have a friend who knew her well enough to suggest she should practice.","No matter how she tried, she was still herself.\nThe rigid and heartless Pali Avramapul, whose sword and tongue were equally vicious.","“Did you and Fitzroy have an argument?”\n“Yes. I keep hurting him,” she admitted. “I don’t know ...”\nOh, she knew why ...\nHow to stop, perhaps.","“Every time he retreats into that blasted emperor face I cannot—I can’t help it. It makes me want to claw off his expression.” She grimaced at the blood on the rock. “And so I do. I’m not proud of myself, Masseo. I shouldn’t be doing this.”","She dared not wish Fitzroy were anywhere near as tactile as he’d once been, when he might well have slung his arm over her shoulder and walked beside her for a ways, with her tucked against his tall lankiness in a way she had never admitted she missed.","“Don’t look like that,” she chided gently, and pointed at a section of her slate sign. “It clearly states that when the Red Company arrives, I’ll be closing.”\n“I didn’t think you were serious,” someone said blankly.\nSardeet smiled kindly at him. “I know, dear.”","“Sayo Kivim, I’m sorry, but I’ve made it very clear that the special cake was yours only if Fitzroy Angursell didn’t come for it—and since he’s here, I’m afraid it really is for him, you know.”","Sardeet’s arms tightened, and then she released her so she could smile into Pali’s eyes, and Pali could only wonder at how happy, how joyous, Sardeet was; she felt solid, grounded, full of life.","“Oh, my dear,” Sardeet said softly, “you have had a hard time of it, haven’t you?”","“It’s good to see you in person,” Sardeet said quietly. “You’ll be happy again, Fitzroy.”\n“Will I?” he asked, softly, urbanely, lightly ironic.","“You look so sad in all your portraits.”\nFitzroy went very still. Perhaps they all did. Certainly they all looked at Sardeet, who laughed merrily.\n“Goodness, didn’t you all know?”","“I always remember you saying your birthday was going to be the fourth day before the spring equinox, because that was the day you met Jullanar and Damian, and the day you first named yourself. So ... happy birthday, Fitzroy. It’s very good to see you again.”","“What is Kissie?” Jullanar asked, regarding the animal with astonishment. “It looks like a furry ...armadillo?”\n“He’s a tiger, isn’t he?” Sardeet said.","“Where did the names come from?” Jullanar asked.\n“Oh, this one is Aurora and the Peacock, but he prefers Pea, and Kissie is from Kissing the Moon, naturally.”","Sardeet reached out and gathered Pali against her side, and held her there while Pali turned her own face into her sister’s long, sweet-scented hair and let her own tears come.","The glitter had been somehow magically generated by Kissie. Sardeet had said the tiger-cats did that, when they really liked someone. Fitzroy had tried not to show how pleased he was at being really liked by the creature.","“You’re angry,” Sardeet observed. “You’re all knotted in yourself.”\n“I’m trying, Sardeeet,” Pali whispered. “I’m really struggling with ... everything.”\n“Everything?”\nThe darkness surely hid her blush. “Fitzroy,” she admitted, even more quietly.","“You might want to ask yourself just why you’re so angry.”\nPali opened her mouth, but had nothing to say.\nSardeet looked up at her.\n“Be gentle with yourself,” Sardeet added, smiling radiantly. “You do not need to fight your way to inner truth.”","Fitzroy had—\nNo matter that. Her inner truth was not about Fitzroy.\n(This was almost certainly a lie, Pali knew, and refused to admit. Why did he have such a hold on her?)","Pali studied the moon gate, wondering how the artist—artists?—had made it.\nWondering, for a brief, wild moment, if she could learn to do such a thing.","Pali scoffed to herself, immediately retreating from the image of a garden somewhere that was full of Jullanar’s flowers and Fitzroy’s music and her own strange, beautiful, precariously balanced stacks of stones.","She had brought Arzu’s carpet, folded and tied about her waist, just in case.\nShe was tempted—\nBut no. Sardeet would surely think that was cheating.\nCome to that, Pali felt it was cheating.","Stoneybridge had felt like home, for a certain value of home.","Pali was not fourteen or eighteen or twenty-eight or even forty.","What it would be, to be full of air and fire, and forced to become that still, serene figure on that golden throne, in that luminous stone room, that ethereal cage of magic and power and responsibility?","“I turned back,” she whispered. “I was afraid. I was afraid ...” She hesitated, but she had to say it, didn’t she? The crow regarded her with one bright-black eye. “I was afraid I would lose myself. I have always been afraid I would lose myself to you.”","“I’m sorry I have been so ...”\nShe trailed off, unable to finish the sentence, watching as the crow lifted his head and turned to face her more directly.\n“Formidable?” came the familiar, resonant, beautiful voice, threaded with humour and power, and Pali jumped, for he was behind her.","“Did you think that was me?”\n“No, I preferred pouring my heart out to a stranger crow,” Pali retorted, unable to muster a sting.","“If you’d rather be alone, I’ll leave you to your thoughts.”\n“Don’t be absurd,” she said. He looked sharply at her, and she said, “You need to rest—” But that was not the truth, or the whole truth, was it? She plucked at the edge of the carpet. “I’d like you to stay.”","But did it matter if he were really Aurelius Magnus? What might that mean? Whether or not he was, he was certainly—certainly—Fitzroy, their Fitzroy, her Fitzroy, himself.","“How did you think of it?” she asked, a question she had never asked.\n“I saw you, and I felt my whole being come into focus ... as if I were a lodestone, and for the first time I had found another.”","She had been sure she would lose herself to him.

Beautiful, for anyone.”","Fitzroy sighed extravagantly. “I am entirely worn-out with all this ... what did Jullanar call it? Healthful conversation?”","“You have a nickname for him.”\n“It’s his family nickname,” Fitzroy replied, almost bashfully. “He gave me permission to use it.”\nPali heard what he did not say: that this Kip, Basil’s cousin Kip—that bureaucrat-of-bureaucrats, his brilliant jailer—had claimed him as family.","“He’s given me so much, Pali.

This would be a debt that lingered ... except he knew this was not a debt, not to Jullanar. It was a gift, freely given.","He had not had to tell her anything, had he? She had seen for herself that he was different, and far from minding, seemed to prefer his company to Alezian’s, which no one had ever done.","Damian, naturally, was striding as quickly and effortlessly as he ever did when not holding a two-person wooden rowboat on his back.\nReally, how did you even get muscles like that?","Alezian always said that everything boiled down to money in the end, although Damian had considered that carefully and still couldn’t see how it could possibly be true. He feared it was one of the things that everyone else understood and he just ... didn’t.","Damian looked up, expecting a large bird, and was deeply, utterly, completely flabbergasted when a person fell out of the sky and landed on them.","“Would you perchance believe me if I were to say I were the Prince of the White Forest, come down from the high places to test hospitality and good humour?”","She blushed, but she did want to be the sort of person who had adventures.

I’ve come in search of my fortune.”\nSo she wasn’t the only one who wanted ... more.","“I do beg your pardon,” she said when they had both more or less calmed down. “This is not Fairyland, and our journey is no quest so noble.”\nSadly. But true.\nThe stranger appeared entirely unconvinced.","“My name is Jullanar.”\n“A name fit for a fairy queen,” he interjected. “I fear I cannot bow as would be appropriate, my lady, and can only offer you my wits and my magic and my harp as poor assistance on this quest of yours. My name is Fitzroy, and I am a bard like the bards of old.”","“My name is Fitzroy, and I am a bard like the bards of old.”\nJullanar stared at him a little more, but he seemed—well, hardly serious, but certainly sincere.","“Isn’t he beautiful,” Fitzroy said.\n“Well—yes, he is, but—”\n“And so strong.”\n“Er, yes, but—”\n“Competent, too.”\nShe opened her mouth, closed it, and smiled weakly at him. “True.”","If he was a god—no. Damian found that hard to believe. No one actually believed in the ancient Calandran gods.\nNo, it must be that the world was far stranger even than Damian had ever thought.","At this point Damian realized how extraordinarily full the bag was, but he was distracted from asking about its unusual capacities by Fitzroy stripping himself naked and then just ... standing there.","He felt a sudden stab of gratitude that he had met her, this young woman who was his opposite in almost every way but for the fact that she, too, was that little bit counter to everyone else.","Damian considered his errand and the fact that he already had Jullanar along with him, and the fact that every possible story his mother had ever told involved the solemn and sacred duty of hospitality.\nWas this how an adventure began?","Always treat a stranger well, his mother said, for you never know who they might be.","This could be the Lord Phoenix come down to see if he was worthy.\nHe wasn’t worthy, but—Damian wasn’t sure how to say it, even to himself, except—he wanted to be worthy. He couldn’t be the great poet, the prince, the eloquent and learned warrior, but he could be courteous, and chivalrous, and try.","He didn’t seem bothered by his bare feet at all, which now struck Jullanar as perhaps the strangest thing about him.\nWell, besides the whole falling-out-of-the-sky part.","It was a very small village, and it was hardly as if he could get lost between the vineyard on one side of the village and the pasture on the other.\n\nIt took them, the stablehand, and half the village of Arkhalops a full hour to find Fitzroy.","Fitzroy was sitting on someone’s front porch being menaced by a rooster. He looked deeply relieved when he saw them.\n“Jullanar,” he said plaintively, “this bird is very angry with me.”","Fitzroy clambered down from the stoop after many assurances from Damian (via Jullanar, who did not fully translate either’s comments) that he would protect him, if necessary, from the other chickens.","“The clouds have burned off, the sun has come out, and, and so have our shadows.”\n“They’re not bad?”\n“They’re shadows.”\n“I’ve never had one before,” Fitzroy said.","“Poor little shadow,” said Fitzroy, patting the shady side of the boat. “What horrors you must have faced finding me.”","“How did you come to fall out of the sky?” she managed finally, bluntly.\nThe poet gave her another sunny smile. “I tripped!”\nOf course.\nShe really didn’t have anything else she could say, to that, did she?","“There are so many people,” Fitzroy said.\n“Twenty, at most.”\n“I’ve never seen so many strangers at once,” Fitzroy said, in a tone somewhere between panic and delight.","He looked, Jullanar thought, the very image of a studious lord. She felt another pang of unease, and something like wonder, at his innocence, his inexplicable arrival, his solitude.","“You would agree, Ema,” he said obliquely, “that it is obligatory to give hospitality to the needful stranger?” \nKasiar stared at him. And that was in Tanteyr. Damian never initiated conversations in Tanteyr.","“Damian—”\nHe turned from the door, his expression impatient if still-polite (though not, ever, curious).\n“Where did you encounter our guest?”\nHe considered.“He fell out of the sky when we were crossing the river.”\nWell. That ... changed things.","“Do you have another name?” Maude persisted.\nHe turned that bright smile back on her. “Not yet! Just Fitzroy.” \n“The Poet,” put in Jullanar, with an odd expression on her face.\n“Yes, that’s right,” he said complacently. “One day it will be renowned the Nine Worlds over.”","“Shall we be friends until the end of time, Jullanar?”\n“Oh, and beyond, most certainly.”","The room seemed to be full of secrets, and Jullanar yearned to understand them.","What a strange person, was her final thought before she gave herself over to enjoying the sound of her own language. The songs were unfamiliar and Fitzroy’s accent odd, but still ... it was a little exciting, she decided.\nJust a little.","“All these people! Listening! To me! This truly is the best day of my life.”","Jullanar was whispering something to the poet, who looked intrigued.\nDamian winced. He might have only known Fitzroy for half a day, but he was already fairly certain him looking intrigued was a dangerous sign.","It felt as if his heart had started to beat again. He looked at Jullanar, blurry though her face was to him, and wondered ... He did not let himself wonder in words. He had to hold those close, tight in his heart, sheltered as a wildcat’s newborn kitten.","“His name,” he said, “is Avandion. He is ... mine.” He gave her a fierce stare. “He is not to be touched by others.”\nHe could not say more than that. He did not have the words—not in Calandran, not even in Tanteyr—to explain what a satall was.","The falcon hesitated a moment, and then rustled its wings. Damian stepped away from Jullanar so he could throw the bird into the sky. It flew up, up, up, in a widening gyre, blinding-white against the blue sky.\n“He’s so beautiful,” Jullanar said, her voice thick. “Thank you, Damian.”","Jullanar had no idea what the falcon meant to Damian, but there was something intensely appropriate about seeing the white bird on his wrist, the fierce dark eye with its golden ring staring deep into hers with what seemed to be an uncanny intelligence.","It gave her goosebumps, and then, when the bird clearly knew its own name—and then, when Damian murmured to the falcon in a mysterious other language—which sounded entirely unlike Calandran—and then launched the gyrfalcon into the air, and it went looking—\nShe had no words. None.","He trusted them, she realized. This stranger, this perfect stranger, who had fallen out of the sky and drunk more than anyone should rightly be able to hold, who had been run out of the city as a witch and ended up—here—\nHe trusted them.","“How did you come to be here?”\nFitzroy had fallen out of the sky. If she could not tell him, then who?\n“I wanted to have an adventure,” she said simply. “I wanted to be someone who could have an adventure.”","“This is like being inside a poem,” Fitzroy said at length, smiling at her so engagingly Jullanar could only smile helplessly back.","I might be this, he had said; I might be that. What was he, in truth?","“She pretends to be a man,” Fitzroy objected. “No, no,” he went on, shaking his head. “You must go on adventures just as you are.”","She smiled at Fitzroy, trying to be as brave as Marianne thought her, as brave as she wanted to be, a woman Of Character. “Well,” she said, not nonchalant but perhaps as close as she’d ever managed, “that depends on whether you’re willing to come adventuring with Damian and me, doesn’t it?”","Fitzroy gave her such a huge and brilliant grin than Jullanar was sure her heart actually stuttered. “I would be honoured and delighted and—and—and—” He stuttered to a halt, and then, in a quieter, simpler tone, said, “This is the best day of my life.”\nIt was probably Jullanar’s, too.","What matter if this was the end of her respectability?

I was finding it hard going to resign myself to that fact.","My first, stupid thought was that banditry must pay far more than I’d imagined, since Myrta had been in my year at Morrowlea and therefore could not have been the Rondelan scholar.","Sela skirted his head to run towards me, then ran back and kicked him in the side.\nI picked her up when she came back. “It’s not nice to kick a man when he’s already down,” I said to her.\n“I couldn’t kick him before,” she said, sticking out her tongue.\nI couldn’t argue with that.","“Well,” I said, and stopped there.\nBen snorted softly. “Well, and a scientific punch that was indeed. Where did you say you worked?”\nI smiled involuntarily. “A bookstore.”","“Promise you won’t go away again?”\nHer voice was terribly anxious. Why would she worry that I would go away? And then I realized that to her life must seem a series of people going away, and not coming back.","We came at last to a single brightly burning light.\nI realized I’d been leading us there unconsciously but to excellent purpose.

I’m still very, very small.”","“Jemis killed the dragon!” Sela cried proudly. “Just like in a story. Except that you didn’t have a sword or a lance or anything proper.”\n“I’ll try to remember for next time.”","Mr. Dart smiled. “Come now, Mr. Greenwing, whatever were you doing in the Yellton Gaol?”\n“I told you,” I said, “I was arrested on charge of murdering Fitzroy Angursell while in the form of a dragon.”\nSela giggled. This seemed the most appropriate response.","“Jemis rescued me from the bad man, Hal,” Sela informed him. “He hit him in the throat and he fell over.”\nSela, I reflected, showed definite signs of a bloodthirsty streak. I wondered at what age it was appropriate to start teaching one’s little sister how to fight.","I pitied Hal’s matter-of-fact acceptance of his duty; I envied him it; I wished I understood my place in the world with such unshakable confidence.","I have no proof whatsoever except for the certainty of my heart.

As far as I knew no one other than Hal (who had been the one to first identify the magic) had noticed this, but then again, there were an awful lot of things about Ragnor Bella that no one mentioned out loud.","I had decided to see how long Mr. Dart could take an insistent lack of questioning before he cracked.\nWe were naturally waylaid by highwaymen long before.","I had recently discovered that there was Fairy blood on my mother’s side, source of my own gift at magic, which was inconsiderable compared to the feats achievable by Astandalan Schooled magic, but not quite so insignificant that it hadn’t managed to waken a dragon to test me.","I had recently discovered that there was Fairy blood on my mother’s side, source of my own gift at magic, which was inconsiderable compared to the feats achievable by Astandalan Schooled magic, but not quite so insignificant that it hadn’t managed to waken a dragon to test me.","He struck a pose, giving Mr. Dart and Jullanar Maebh direct engagement with his codpiece (really?

The Lord of Ysthar is the most prolific contributor.

What grace that is to me?”","“And you, my friend, for I feel you are my friend, read my poem more carefully and understood it more fully than anyone else, and by it was able to rescue your friends and yourself from your imprisonment.”\n“I’m not sure if I can say I rescued myself,” I pointed out, “since I died.”","The words tumbled out, inarticulate and broken, even as I tried to stop sobbing. “You said all those nice things about me and left me all that money and all your colleagues were so kind, and I never once told you I loved you!”\n“Oh, Jemis, I knew.”","“Lady,” she said, “my son is hearing his friend calling his name.”\nThe Lady’s face went solemn, though the merriment did not leave her eyes and the blossoms did not fall. “Ah, my dear Champion is coming into his power at last.”","I was my father’s son, and I could not leave Mr. Dart to fight the Dark Kings alone when it was through me they might find entry to the world.","Mr. Dart jumped violently and whirled around to stare at me. “Jemis!”\n“The same,” I replied, smiling, as I bowed. “It’s good to see you.”\n“You’re dead,” he said sharply.\n“At the moment, yes.”","My bear-baiter, Hal had called Mr. Dart, leading where I followed.

You shouldn’t be grinning.”\nI knew better that to say, We just fought off—you just fought off—the Dark Kings—not when they might yet hear—and so I instead took his arm, as if we were walking down the high street of Ragnor Bella, and turned our steps to the one sunlit road.","“My body couldn’t handle the abnegation of my magical gift, such as it is, and so I died.”\n“We had worked that out,” Violet said, her voice sharp. “It’s how you came back to life that’s the question.”","Hal leaned down to put a hand on his shoulder, as he still sat on the floor. “Marcan, get hold of yourself.

That ... was a strange coincidence, if coincidence it was.","It struck me as quite likely that someone whose magic called forth a unicorn foal, of all things, was probably to be trusted when it came to judgments of character.

How could anyone with any pretensions to humanity?","Many years ago, before the Game had begun, even before Astandalas fell in a fountain of black magic, Raphael and Heloise had been friends.

He had not forgotten that she, too, was an actor.","He’d lived through the end of the world, once, before he came into magic, when Astandalas fell. He had no desire to see such a thing again.","Perhaps it would be easier if he forgot that once he and Circe had been friends.","It was three days before the end of the Game, and he was the Lord of Ysthar. He had his duties to fill his mind and his heart. Certainly he did not think how once he had sung so that the trees walked to hear him, and the winds knew his name.","He should kill Circe to win the Game. Shouldn’t he? He should do everything possible to win, whatever the personal cost. Shouldn’t he? He shouldn’t choose inclination over duty, whatever Will suggested. Should he?","He could not have said what it was that told him that this was Kasian, except that everything did.","“High court?”\n“Oh, of course, you wouldn’t know, would you?

There didn’t seem any particular reason you couldn’t.”","And if perhaps his friends had just learned his name, that that aloof small mage and artist was called Raphael, well, he had to admit he was rather relieved, in that distant marionette way, that he would not end the Game with no one to know his real name.","A year when she made him speak and a year when she listened to him. He had not known what a conversation could be, till that day and that year, never guessed that in speaking there could be as much delight for him as there was in music.","Music had always been the only activity where his body did exactly what his mind desired of it.","He had stood on the edge of the sea looking at the roiling water where there once had been an island, and it was then that he renounced his music.

He had held on so stubbornly, so long.","Waiting for death, she was smiling.\nWaiting for life, he was terrified.","“What were you doing to be injured like this?”\n“A foolish bet,” he replied in what was probably the understatement of the century.","He stepped forward into James Inelu-being-a-film-star. This meant a smile that both acknowledged and broke off the attention without anxiety, difficulty, or embarrassment for any party.

That broke the protections.”\n“But Grandmère put them on our family.”\n“What do you think disowning means? It’s not just a legal term.”\n“Magic answers to such things?”\n“Magic is such things.

Won’t you trust me?”\nTrust? he thought. The word Kasian used for you, fhira, was the tenderest and most intimate word for family relations and friendships, one only to be used with one’s best-beloved.\nTrust. Whom else should he trust but his brother, his friend, his king?","Robin, who was the only other true magus in the room, blenched. Raphael was pleased to see he, at least, understood what it might be like to lose one of his major faculties. “The nirgal slaurigh actually worked?”\n“For nearly a full day.” His voice was still savagely calm.","The winds howled down the sky. “I think you are all assuming I lost,” he said ringingly. “It was last Wednesday.”","She was wearing a fantastic gown several yards longer than could possibly have been practical, a dress that looked like a bonfire in the rain. It streamed across the bridge around her, while her magic curved its back to the wind.","“Was there a reason beyond unsolicited amateur psychology for your meeting me tonight?”\nThe apprehension and the amusement swirled up into a laugh. “Darling Raphael, I am no amateur.”\nNo, he thought, she wasn’t. That was why she had brought him so close to despair.","“You gave me my life. I give you my forfeit. Accept what you have done, O Lord.

Will you teach me?”\n“What?” Raphael said stupidly in response.\nRobin’s voice was passionate, far removed from his usual detached mockery. “Will you teach me magic? Please?”","Robin said, “I’ve seen great magi lose control. The Queen my mother, for instance, when I told her I was emigrating to Ysthar, where things are less ... whimsical. What you did in my house was not losing control.

I couldn’t. It was wrong, all wrong.”","“I don’t have a defense,” he said, “except she looked at the sun and smiled, and I thought: how can I? How can this be right? How could I look on you with that on my hands?”","Apropos of nothing Raphael could see, Robin asked, “Did you know Orpheus?” A pause, while Raphael tried to think how to answer that.

No one had ever asked him.","The Adversary had made it so that he could not think of music—and he thought in music—without his magic following the path of his thought and changing reality.","The Eater of Worlds was patient; he thought nothing of time. He would remember the one who had defied him once before. He would remember the one who was playing—had played—had played—and won—and won—the game whose rules he had set into creation.","He had thought Wednesday would be the end of all his stories.\nAnd yet Scheherezade the Storyteller had promised him that there was always another story after one finished.","His heart might have been the hammer that wrought Blake’s tiger.

Fencing or dancing or anything physical is even worse. But music—oh, Kas, that came to me the way fencing comes to Da.”","“‘The Ballad of Seven Buttons’ is one of my favourite songs,” Kasian said severely. “You wrote it? And never told me? And ‘Tarazel’?

But there were no wizards such as his mother described in any of his armies.","Thus he rode, for perhaps the first time in his life, alone.","He would, at least, present his request. It was not an order; that was why he had come alone.","It was rather an odd feeling, to have a stranger look so deeply on him. Most people, he knew, found his eyes rather uncanny, and of course as the emperor he dared not let many come close.","He always wore a sword; always.

Her nights grew brighter, as she captured ever more starlight and bound it into her ice-crystal city.","Klara crawled into a nest of shadows, curled around her cold heart and the silence that should have been the singing voice of her friend, her rival, her lover, her beloved, and there, for a long time, she stayed.","The third age began with the first return of the elves from Over the Waves, in blue ships with sails of gold, and the triumphant march of the King of the Exiles back to the city of which he had once been the prince.\nHe found the city where he had left it, but not as he had left it at all.","The King of the Exiles said, “I am the King of the Firnoi, and yet the city of the Firnoi knows me no longer.”\nKlara said, “You are the King of the Exiles, and this is the city of those who stayed.”","The King of the Exiles built a wall, sturdy and strong, around what he called the old city. Klara shifted its position until she had all the land she desired within its circuit.","“I swear never shall I rest until I have made you mine.”\nToo late he realized the trap he had made for himself.\nKlara smiled at him, cold and dark. “So be it.”","Though he stood tall and proud when once again on the streets that were his, it still shivered at his feet, his shadow, and it was lighter than it had been, greyer, as if the King was not quite so solid as he had been before he entered the Old City and challenged her there.","Though it was not clear what it was, exactly, something was lost with death, with the passage through the Halls of Rest.","Over the Waves, Tamsin was losing himself. He saw his brothers constantly now, and in the dreams Klara shared they crowded close in their concern.","“It has been winter a long time in this city,” Alina said presently.

He had not wept for a long, long time; not since the last ship had sailed back to Elfland across the sea, and he stood truly alone on the farther shore.\nThis side of the sea, Klara wept, and her tears washed away the ice in her heart, and the hurt in her heart.","Tamsin closed his eyes, but he could still see the light; could not see anything but the light, as he closed his reaching hands upon the fire, the branch of the flame imperishable his father had once brought down from the holy mountain.","With it finally in his broken grasp, released himself and all his brothers from the chains of the Oath with which they had bound themselves.\nThis side of the sea, Klara felt the flame catch in the space between her cupped palms.","There she stood, and looked for a long time east, in silence.\nFor after so long enduring past everything but hope, far Over the Waves Tamsin let himself slide irretrievably out of her grasp as he gave himself over at last to the welcoming embrace of the sea.","“Will my seventh son come home?” Alina asked, her voice steady.\nThe raven’s voice was very deep when it replied. “He has gone to his rest. He will waken only when the song of his soul is ready.”","Klara did not disabuse anyone of the assumption that the dark-haired singer who could sometimes be found at the side of Daerleon the Stonehand was Tamsin called Korrokaith.","The years passed, swift and fair.","She was the Great Enchantress, the Lady of Starlight and Shadow and Song, the Keeper of the Holy Fire.

Daerleon the sculptor, proud of his strength and his skill.\nForro. Armion. Daerleon. The other names would come. Three had, and three more would there be before he reached the city.","Day by day Tamsin’s memory was coming back to him, as if with each step he was shedding the weight of the years and regaining all their delights instead.","“I’d like to hear what your hair sounds like,” River said, all encouragement.\n“It’s so wilful,” Ash added, deadpan.\nTamsin wrinkled his nose at her, which made the dour warrior grin, River-like, at him, and set down the frame of his harp so he could begin the slow process of picking out his braids.","He tuned the strings, shadow-black and limned with gold, and then for the first time since that first morning, Tamsin Tammorath played the Dawnsong upon the harp in fair Elfland.","“Imagine,” River said dreamily, “other people!” Ash raised her eyebrows, and River hastily backtracked. “I mean—not that I don’t love you both⁠—”\nAn utterly impossible inclusion, that both. River was so free with words. So free.","“See,” said River. “You know our parents would say we should listen to our teacher, Ash.”\nTamsin shouldn’t have been so proud of the appellation. He shouldn’t. But he couldn’t stop himself from grinning as they continued the long descent from the Downs.","A lament came to mind first, as was only natural, but even as he struck the first notes, he seemed to feel the harp sigh, and he could only describe the feeling of it under his hands as sulky.","The harp was very new to have such decided opinions—something that usually emerged after years if not decades of playing—but then Tamsin had made it out of bones and hair and hope.","Death came crowned in moonlight and blood, said one of the songs of Tamsin Korrokaith. But Tamsin had worn red for his brothers and silver for Klara Kanorath, and he had faced his dead on the bridge over the Swanlands. He would not put away his colours now.","There was no hint of an enchantment or a curse on the people, and yet—and yet it was clear that until he started to play the old songs, there had been something missing.","The people seemed to waken out of a deep dream, shake off a skiff of ... not quite grief, not quite melancholy, not quite boredom ... something, anyway, like dust that had settled on an unused instrument.\nWhat could Tamsin do, but keep playing?","Fighting, Rowan moved like the shadows did when he sang them into a nest of protection of an evening. He moved like the wind did, when he sang a note and called a passing breeze like a falcon to his wrist. He moved like water always downhill, like fire always upward.","Fighting, Rowan moved like the shadows did when he sang them into a nest of protection of an evening.

Armion in yellow and white, no weapons visible, a smudge of charcoal on his cheek, blue ink on his fingers where they were scrabbling on the rim of the pot.\nOh it was true, those old legends.

Not a stranger at all.\nHe meant to say Tamsin, but what he said was, “How are you still wearing that same tunic?”","Armion said, awkwardly sincere, “We know you couldn’t see or hear us.”\n“Oh,” Tamsin said, reeling.

Not the bloody, vindictive shades of his guilt; but when he had imagined that there was always one of his brothers walking at his side, keeping pace with his relentless movement, that had been true.","Klara had been full of silence when she laid down the first layers of this garden. Silence and grief and rage that had hardened into ice, the opposite and match of his Song and grief and the rage that had burned so fiercely until it had charred out his very heart.","All those tongueless bells, singing forth. All those silver trees, blooming gold. All Klara’s shadows, pouring towards him like the waters rushing down a cataract.\nThe road curved, the stairs opened up, the colonnades shifted, and Tamsin walked home.","She stood silent in the midst of song; stood transfixed by hope and fear, so perfectly balanced.\nTamsin, Tamsin, cried her heart.\nTamsin, Tamsin sang the city, her city, his city.","Down she went and down, her voice rising up, twining with his, gold and silver as the sun and the moon, their voices mingling like starlight reflected on a still pool."]}
